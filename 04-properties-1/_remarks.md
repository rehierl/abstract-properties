visualize a section
- by underlining the nodes the section contains
- increase "visibility" by drawing boxes around the nodes

underlining nodes
- corresponds with a subset
- understood to define a subset
- an output tape of a touring machine

generic properties
- introduce the basic concept of generic properties
- based on the mathematical lists/sequences/tuples
- forwards-/backwards-oriented perspectives
- in terms of "fluid dynamics"?

the document order
- can be visualized as a sequence of nodes
- can be visualized as a path graph

abstraction of properties
- define "a characteristic of sorts"
- defining node - sectioning node

at that point
- can only clearly define the scope (all-of)
- can/should not yet clearly define "context"

# mid-/long-term

relationships between scopes
- shared across multiple nodes

# from the ordered-trees repository

- a goal-driven approach, not a bottom-up approach
- the stream-based perspective does not really apply
  since a property applies to all the nodes that are
  subsequent to its defining node
- that was the old approach - based on some-of
- the old approach did jump too far
- immediately jumped to multiple/shared properties
- failed to take one small step at a time
