visualize a section
- by underlining the nodes the section contains
- increase "visibility" by drawing boxes around the nodes

a matter of perspective
- the scope of a node is forwards-oriented
- i.e. the propagation of a property along the edges
- the context of a node is backwards-oriented
- introduce "context" just briefly - not in depth - later

underlining nodes
- corresponds with a subset
- understood to define a subset
- an output tape of a turing machine

generic properties
- introduce the basic concept of generic properties
- based on the mathematical lists/sequences/tuples
- forwards-/backwards-oriented perspectives
- in terms of "fluid dynamics"?

the document order
- can be visualized as a sequence of nodes
- can be visualized as a path graph

abstraction of properties
- define "a characteristic of sorts"
- defining node - sectioning node

at that point
- can only clearly define the scope (all-of)
- can/should not yet clearly define "context"

# mid-/long-term

relationships between scopes
- shared across multiple nodes

turing machines
- the idea of turing machine that pops up on a regular basis
- the core concept of a multi-tape/track machine
- section properties written to additional tapes
- hence, this "image" can be used to imagine
  the relationships between multiple sections/properties
- hence, in principle a future issue

# from the ordered-trees repository

- a goal-driven approach, not a bottom-up approach
- the stream-based perspective does not really apply
  since a property applies to all the nodes that are
  subsequent to its defining node
- that was the old approach - based on some-of
- the old approach did jump too far
- immediately jumped to multiple/shared properties
- failed to take one small step at a time
