# mid-/long-term

relationships between scopes
- shared across multiple nodes

turing machines
- the idea of a turing machine pops up on a regular basis
- the core concept of a multi-tape/track machine
- section properties written to additional tapes
- this "image" can be used to imagine the relationships
  between multiple sections/properties

# from the ordered-trees repository

- a goal-driven approach, not a bottom-up approach
- the stream-based perspective does not really apply
  since a property applies to all the nodes that are
  subsequent to its defining node
- that was the old approach - based on some-of
- the old approach did jump too far
- immediately jumped to multiple/shared properties
- failed to take one small step at a time
