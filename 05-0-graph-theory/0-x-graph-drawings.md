# graph drawings

Graph drawing refers to the visual representation of a graph. That is, the
methods that are being used to draw a graph onto a two-dimensional plane.
Most frequently, a graph is drawn as a node-link diagram that depicts vertices
as disks or boxes, and the edges as arrows or lines between the vertices.
Examples for such drawings are flowcharts (the vertices represent processing
steps and the edges control flow) and hasse diagrams (drawings of partial
orders).

Despite its visual representation, one must keep in mind that the visual
representation of a graph is the specific layout of the graph's endo-relation.
That is, a graph (i.e. its endo-relation) can in general be layed out using
various different methods. A particular graph drawing must therefore not be
confused with the graph's underlying endo-relation.

Note that the focus of this discussion is on the endo-relation of a graph,
not on its visual representation.
