A graph G := (V,E) is defined as an endo-relation that has (directed) edges
(E) which connect its vertices (V). Since a general graph has no requirement
as to why two of its vertices are connected, the main focus in the context
of a general graph is on the connections between pairs of vertices, not so
much on the overall characteristics of a graph.

Since a general graph does not have to satisfy any structural requirement,
a general graph has no overall characteristics. A general graph can therefore
be understood as a relation that has a seemingly arbitrary set of edges. As
such, no conclusion can be drawn based upon shared characteristics. That is
because such characteristics are not guaranteed do exist.

Therefore, requirements need to be introduced that define sub-groups of graphs
such that each graph in a group has the characteristics described. These shared
characteristics then allow to draw conclusions in the context of such a group.

Note that the structure of a graph may be understood as its "syntax",
and the reason as to why two vertices are connected as its "semantics".
