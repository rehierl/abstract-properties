- a recap on graph theory / node trees

bipartite graph
- V is a union of two disjoint subsets
- bends the rules of an endo-relation
- i.e. a simple binary relation

graph theory seems to focus on edges
- disconnected vertices (seem) to be (mostly) ignored
- e.g. the (standard) definition of a complement graph

graph theory seems to treat vertices and edges
  as being mostly independent from one another
- i.e. vertices may be (almost) arbitrarily connected
- i.e. there is (some) degree of freedom in choosing the edges
