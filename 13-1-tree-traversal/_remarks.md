# tree traversal

- treat a node trace as a super-sequence of interleaved
  (traces of nodes) and overlapping sub-sequences (rooted paths)
- vertical orders (i.e. rps) and horizontal orders (i.e. child orders)

an embedding consists of an ordering rule and an order of execution
- rule - how a sequence is formed - additional edges
- execution - in which order these rules must be applied
- in regards to the overall serialization ?
- i.e. child order, then pre-order
