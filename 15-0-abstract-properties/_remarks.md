# abstract properties (3)
- define "types of scopes"

introduce the term "type x scope of node y"
- based upon the corresponding node order

introduce the term "type-x descendants"?
- based on the definition of "types of scopes"
- instead of "the descendants in the the un-ordered tree"
- a descendant in regards to the type-x node order

the general pattern of defining scopes
- also applies to total orders
- type-0 - no edges have been added
- type-1 - the edges of the order
- the resulting order is total
- no more types possible
