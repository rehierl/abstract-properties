prefix-order (non-standard)
- a downward-total partial order
- if (a < c) and (b < c), then also (a related-to b)

suffix-order (non-standard)
- an upward-total partial order
- if (a > b) and (a > c), then also (b related-to c)

prefix/suffix - extended pov
- an induced subtree can be seen as an extended suffix
- similar to that - extended prefixes

extensions are not necessarily total
- one should speak of downward/upward total orders
- avoid using prefix/suffix order except if extended
- both refer to different "things"

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
- rooted paths

setup-t3-partial
- since each tree must have one and only one root
- rps are either related ex-or overlap each other
- i.e. rps are never disjoint

the issue with rooted paths
- overlaps can't be visualized that easily
