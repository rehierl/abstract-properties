- Hpre - a hierarchy of pre-order traces

equivalent to that
- a family of rev-post-order traces
- recall - preD is reversed to preR

generalize to "a hierarchy/family of strings"
- just to proof that it does add up
- efficiency - the ce() as the first/last item
- a tag soup ain't no (fucking) node tree

essential to proof that a tree can be encoded
- as a sequence of length values
- as a sequence of level values
- level - the number of current scopes

traces/scopes are ..
- related or disjoint/subsequent
- overlap - cant uniquely determine the relationship
- i.e. neither a super- and no a sub-set
- i.e. if overlap, then no least-significant superset
