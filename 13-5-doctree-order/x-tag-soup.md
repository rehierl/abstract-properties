- added in here since the correct perception
  of a tag soup is critical to the discussion
- the issue is with people who deal with trees
  only in the form of a tag soup ... misleading

todo
- the document order is the doctree's pre-order trace
- in pre-order (!)

# the tag-based syntax

- this will also allow to read the scopes
  from the tag-based syntax ..
- so yeah, in here a must-be

a tag soup ain't no (fucking) node tree
- derive the family of scopes from a tag soup
- the tag-based syntax is an application of generic
  properties, which is an application of order theory

the some-but-not-all qualifier
- an end-tag separates a node's type-1 (t1) descendants
  from its remaining t2 descendants - i.e. from the
  subsequent siblings and their t1 descendants
- or - from the next subsequent sibling and its t2 descendants
- as such, an end-tag provides a clear definition
  for the some-but-not-all case/qualifier
- a partition of its type-2 descendants

has consequences in regards to ..
- the start-/end-tags
- each node corresponds with its start-tag
- a node's end-tag marks the end of
  the node's type-1 scope - nothing more
- "visiting a node" in general only corresponds
  with processing the node's start-tag
- the enter/exit order as an order of events
- "entering and exiting node"
