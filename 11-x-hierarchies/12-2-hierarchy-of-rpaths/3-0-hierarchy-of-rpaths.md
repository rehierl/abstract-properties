# Forest/Hierarchy of rpaths

Note that a family of rooted paths `S`, if formed from a tree `T(N,E)`, is a
hierarchy of rooted paths `H`. Any tree is therefore isomorphic to a hierarchy
of rooted paths.

## a forest of rpaths (F)

```

| |-2-| |-3-| | | |-5-| |      s2: (1,2)

A partial setup `S` may be referred to as **a forest of rooted paths**,
if the following requirements are met:

* (R0) `S` is a normalized setup of rooted paths.

Note that a forest of rooted paths may have any number of root paths,
including none at all.

* `(#RS(F) in [0,*])` is true

Note that a forest of rooted paths has no additional requirements. Because
of that, a forest of rooted paths `F` may contain disjoint, related and also
overlapping rooted paths (i.e. the **DI-RE-OV** case).

Note that the disjoint case allows to tell that disjoint rooted paths belong
to different trees. In contrary to that, two disjoint sets in the context of
a forest of scopes may or may not belong to the same tree.

## a hierarchy of rpaths (H)

A partial setup `S` may be referred to as **a hierarchy of rpaths**,
if the following requirements are met:

* (R1) `S` is a forest of rooted paths.
* (R2) `S` has one and only one root.

Note that a hierarchy `H` of rooted paths has the following properties:

* `(#RS(H) == 1)` must be true
* `(#S > 0)` - A hierarchy is always non-empty.
* `(Ã˜ !in H)` - No path in a hierarchy is empty.
* All the paths in a hierarchy are "RE ex-or OV".
* Each path has no ex-or one parent - a prefix.
* Each path may have any number of child paths.
* Any ancestor has fewer elements than all of its descendants.
* Each path has a unique rooted path.

## set of all hierarchies (UH) and forests (UF)

The theoretical **set of all possible hierarchies (UH)** and the theoretical
**set of all possible forests (UF)** can be defined as follows:

* `UH := { h | "h is a hierarchy" }`
* `UF := { f | "f is a forest of hierarchies" }`

Because of that, the expression `(h in UH)` states that `h` is expected to be
a hierarchy. Likewise, `(f in UF)` states that `f` is expected to be a forest
of hierarchies.

* `(UH proper-subset-of UF)`

## remarks

Note that a hierarchy of rooted paths is a forest of rooted paths, but not
necessarily also vice versa. The latter is because a setup may have more than
one root.

* forest <-> normalized setup
* hierarchy -> normalized setup

Note that two hierarchies `H1` and `H2` are **disjoint**, if their universal
sets are disjoint. Based on that, any path in `H1` is disjoint to each path
in `H2`.

* `(H1 disjoint-to H2) := (U(H1) disjoint-to U(H2))`

Note that an arbitrary **subset** of a hierarchy is neither guaranteed to be
a hierarchy, nor a forest. That is because an arbitrary subset is not required
to include all the prefixes of all the paths it contains.

Note that, except for the required prefixes, the definition of a hierarchy does
not cover the process of forming the paths it contains. It merely describes how
these are related with each other. That is, the sequences in a hierarchy may be
formed in any number of different ways. However, the description as "a hierarchy
of rooted paths" does highlight the main method - i.e. contains all the rooted
paths of a node tree.
