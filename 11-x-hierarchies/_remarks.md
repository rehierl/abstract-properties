suffix-order
- a set of all rooted paths acts as a prefix-order
- a set of all induced subtrees acts as a (partial) suffix-order

needs an overview
- summarize the isomorphisms
- point out which are most important

# overall

- replace each non-essential (:)
- remove occurences of "(if) and only if"

a setup of sets
- as an ordered sequence of sets
- the index order provides node identifiers
- can also be understood to embed a child order

simple sets have no inner order
- not quite right - the order is such that any
  element is subsequent to every other element
- due to transitivity, even subsequent to itself
- in that regards, the inner order of a simple
  set of elements is total
- that is, the number of connections between
  the elements is maximal
- so the order of a simple set can not be in
  conflict with the inner order of another set
- meh - total is in regards to the related-to
  operator, not in regards to the number of edges
- the issue is with the definition of total order
- better use "linear order" and "downward-linear" ?!?
- that edit will be a lot of work ...
