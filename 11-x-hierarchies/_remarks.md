needs an overview
- summarize the isomorphisms
- point out which are most important

a hierarchy of things
- as a note in a readme/summary
- is itself not required to be hierarchical
- e.g. a hierarchy of rooted paths, edges
- a hierarchy must embed the definition of a tree
- a hierarchy must allow to form/derive a tree

the universal set/graph issue
- figure out what the general case is
- pick one and drop the other

hierarchy of rpaths v2
- similar to a hierarchy of scopes
- a hierarchy of reversed scopes
- see - axiomatic set theory
- the r-scopes of each rooted path
- what's an abstraction of "context"?
- i.e. antonymous to "scope"
