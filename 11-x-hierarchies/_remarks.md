a hierarchy of things
- as a note in a readme/summary
- is itself not required to be hierarchical
- e.g. a hierarchy of rooted paths, edges
- a hierarchy must embed the definition of a tree
- i.e. a hierarchy must correspond with a tree

the universal set/graph issue
- figure out what the general case is
- pick one and drop the other
