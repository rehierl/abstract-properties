needs an overview
- summarize the isomorphisms
- point out which are most important

a hierarchy of things
- as a note in a readme/summary
- is itself not required to be hierarchical
- e.g. a hierarchy of rooted paths, edges
- a hierarchy must embed the definition of a tree
- a hierarchy must allow to form/derive a tree

the universal set/graph issue
- figure out what the general case is
- pick one and drop the other

# overall

- replace each non-essential (:)
- remove occurences of "(if) and only if"

simple sets have no inner order
- not quite right - the order is such that
  any element is related to every other element
- in that regards, the inner order of a simple
  set of elements is total
- so the order of two simple sets can not be in
  conflict with the inner order of another set
- the issue with the definition of total order
- better use "linear order" and "downward-linear"

a setup of sets
- as an ordered sequence of sets
- the index order provides node identifiers
- can also be understood to embed a child order
