# variations of setups
- thus far mostly a chapter of bullet points
- i.e. a work in progress ..

the goal ..
- find non-standard applications
- find possible variations

a critical remark (!)
- one should not focus on the edges/paths
- focus on presequent/subsequent instead
- the elements themselves must be ignored
- root/parent/child - structural definitions
- independent of the related-to operator
- independent of types of elements
