variations of partial orders (posets)

- posets allow more than containment orders can support
- with superset-of/subset-of, with (di and/or ov),
  with/against the orientation of the edges
- what are the general characteristics of each combo?
- what do containment orders support?

see partial orders in order theory

- not required to have even one edge/path
- may have any number of disconnected components
- each vertex may have any number of incoming/outgoing edges
- each component must have a root and a leaf - no cycles
- each component may have any number of source/sink vertices
- a component may have parallel sub-components

containment orders

- a subset can not have disjoint supersets
- a subset can have overlapping supersets
- i.e. can support parallel subcomponents
