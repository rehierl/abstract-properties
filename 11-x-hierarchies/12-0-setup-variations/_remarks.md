# variations of setups
- point out that a partial order is more than what meets the eye

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## variants of partial orders (poset)

* posets allow more than containment orders can support
* with superset-/subset-of, with (di and/or ov),
  with the orientation of the edges with/against
* what are the general characteristics of each combo?
* what do containment orders support?

see partial orders in order theory

* not required to have even one edge/path
* may have any number of disconnected components
* each vertex may have any number of incoming/outgoing edges
* each component must have a root and a leaf
* each component may have any number of source/sink vertices
* a component may have parallel sub-components

containment orders

* a subset can not have disjoint supersets
* can support parallel subcomponents - iff supersets overlap
