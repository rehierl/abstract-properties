# trees in set theory (ST)

- a short summary on trees in ST

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
# trees P(T,<) in axiomatic set theory (AST)

- ht(t) := { (s in T) | (s < t) } is well-ordered
- well-ordered := total + each subset hat a least

note that ..
- ht() can be described as a reversed scope
- ht() decreases in size towards the root
- ht() corresponds with a rooted path
- the set of nodes in a rooted path

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
# trees in descriptive set theory (DST)

- a collection of (ordered) sequences
- each prefix of every sequence must be an element

note that ..
- ordered by "prefix-of"

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
# remarks

- both concepts focus on prefixes
- since maths needs to deal with infinity
- smaller numbers are less significant (downwards)
- larger numbers are more significant (upwards)
