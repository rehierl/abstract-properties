# trees in set theory (ST)

- a short summary on trees in ST

trees P(T,<) in axiomatic set theory (AST)
- ht(t) := { (s in T) | (s < t) } is well-ordered
- well-ordered := total + each subset hat a least
- note - ht() decreases in size towards the root
- note - ht() is a hierarchy of reversed scopes
- note - ht() corresponds with a rooted path

trees in descriptive set theory (DST)
- a collection of (ordered) sequences
- each prefix of every sequence must be a node in T
- note - ordered by "prefix-of"

remarks
- both concepts focus on prefixes
- larger numbers are more significant
- since maths needs to deal with infinity
