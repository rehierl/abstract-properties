which endpoint acts as the CE of an edge?
- its source node? - similar to induced subtrees
- its sink node? - similar to rooted paths
- could depend on the orientation of a path/edge
- a scope contains nodes of its descendants
- an rscope contains nodes of its ancestors
- none of those contain nodes in the other direction
- i.e. they are uni-directional in that regards
- an edge is different in that regards since it
  provides a connection in both directions
- core issue is - edges are not embedded into one another
- might depend on one's point of view
