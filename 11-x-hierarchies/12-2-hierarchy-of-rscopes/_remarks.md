hierarchy of rpaths v2
- similar to a hierarchy of scopes
- a hierarchy of reversed scopes
- see - axiomatic set theory
- the r-scopes of each rooted path
- what's an abstraction of "context"?
- i.e. antonymous to "scope"

Note that future discussions might define reversed scopes as "the context".
After all, each such scope contains all the nodes that may be the defining
node of some property such that some current node is within its scope. At
this point, such a definition is however not required.

- minimal in regards to the information it holds
