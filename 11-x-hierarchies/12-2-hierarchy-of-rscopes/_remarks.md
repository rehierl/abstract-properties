hierarchy of rpaths v2
- similar to a hierarchy of scopes
- a hierarchy of reversed scopes
- see - axiomatic set theory
- the r-scopes of each rooted path
- what's an abstraction of "context"?
- i.e. antonymous to "scope"

Note that future discussions might define reversed scopes as "the context of a
node". After all, each such scope holds all the nodes that may be the defining
node of some property that have a scope in which some current node is located.
However, at this point, that point of view must be treated as "an educated
guess". That is, it might or might not turn out to be of any use.

- minimal in regards to the information it holds
