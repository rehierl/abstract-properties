# family of trees

proof (NT <-> induced subtrees)
a tree corresponds with a hierarchy of sets
- here - a tree corresponds with a hierarchy of trees
- can still be used as an example for orders
  that can be formed from a tree
- i.e. not each element in such an order has to be
  "atomic" or "a set of elements" - can be anything
- can still be used to point out that
  **a hierarchy of scopes is itself hierarchical**
- i.e. a set and all its subsets in that family
  corresponds with a subtree
- as such - not without any value
