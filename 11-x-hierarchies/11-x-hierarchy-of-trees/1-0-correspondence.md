# A tree corresponds with a tree of trees

unordered tree <=> hierarchy of trees

An unordered tree allows to form a hierarchy of trees such that the initial
tree can be recreated from it. Likewise, a hierarchy of trees allows to from
an unordered tree, which in turn allows to recreate the initial hierarchy.
That is, each unordered tree corresponds with a hierarchy of trees. And since
an unordered forest is the disjoint union of unordered trees, each such forest
corresponds with a hierarchy/forest of trees.
