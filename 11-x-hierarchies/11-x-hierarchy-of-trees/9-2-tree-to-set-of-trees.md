# Unordered tree => Hierarchy of (sub)trees

Note that the definition of a hierarchy of trees does not cover the process of
forming the trees it contains. It merely describes how these need to be related
with each other. That is, the subtrees of a hierarchy's root may be formed in
any number of ways (e.g. as generic or induced subtrees). Hence, further aspects
need to be taken into account in order to choose one method over the other.

example
- form a hierarchy of all induced subtrees
