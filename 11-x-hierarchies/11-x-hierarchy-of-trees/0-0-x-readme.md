# hierarchy of trees

```
T <-> Ht
```

A tree (T) allows to form a hierarchy of induced subtrees (Ht) such that the
source tree can be recreated from it. That is, each tree is isomorphic to a
hierarchy of subtrees. Because of that, this isomorphism may be referred to
as **the T-Ht isomorphism**.

Note that this isomorphism is intended to showcase that a tree can be isomorphic
to a hierarchy of complex elements. That is, the elements in a hierarchy (or
the corresponding order) are not required to be a primitive/atomic values, or
simple sets of elements. Put differently, the elements in a hierarchy may be
complex in nature.

Note that, since the set of nodes of an induced subtree is equal to the scope
of the subtree's root, and since even subtrees are isomorphic to a hierarchy
of scopes, the T-Ht isomorphism can be understood to already be covered by the
T-Hs isomorphism. That is because the definition of the input tree is embedded
into the sets of nodes of its induced subtrees and the relationships between
these sets of nodes.

## the Hs-Ht isomorphism

```
T <-> Ht <-> Hs
|<----------->|
```

Since a tree is isomorphic to a hierarchy of scopes (T-Hs) and also isomorphic
to a hierarchy of (induced) subtrees (T-Ht), one can conclude that a hierarchy
of scopes (Hs) is itself isomorphic to a hierarchy of subtrees (Ht). After all,
a set and all the subsets of it in Hs can be described as a sub-hierarchy of
scopes, and thus to hold the definition of the corresponding induced subtree.

Note that this isomorphism is inteded to showcase that a hierarchy of scopes
can itself be understood to be hierarchical.
