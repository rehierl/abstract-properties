# A partial setup (of sets)

Note that the focus of this discussion is on rooted setups that are isomorphic
to node trees. As such, these setups must embed (1) the definition of each
node, and (2) the definition of the tree's structure.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## unique identifiers

```
S: a partial setup                              S: a partial setup
=========================================  <=>  ==================
|-A-------------------------------------|       S := {
| |-B-----------| |-E-| |-F-----------| |         A: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },
| | |-C-| |-D-| | | 3 | | |-G-| |-H-| | |         B: { 1, 2          },
| | | 1 | | 2 | | |---| | | 4 | | 5 | | |         C: { 1             },
| | |---| |---| |       | |---| |---| | |         D: {    2          },
| |-------------|       |-------------| |         E: {       3       },
|---------------------------------------|         F: {          4, 5 },
                                                  G: {          4    },
                                                  H: {             5 } }
```

Note that, except for leaf sets, no set in the above setup has a characteristic
element. That is, the characteristic subsets of sets A, B, and F are empty.

* `(css(s) == Ã˜)` for `(s in {A,B,F})`

Since one can (randomly) iterate over the sets in `S`, and since each `(s in S)`
is distinct to every other set, one can define a set of identifiers `ID` such
that it holds a unique id for each set in `S`. Based on that, a binary relation
`R(S,ID,G)`, which associates an `(id in ID)` with each set, can be defined.

* `G(R) := { (s,ID(s)) | for (s in S) }`

Based on being able to test simple sets for equality, one can define a bijective
function `ID(s)` such that it returns the id of a given set, and an inverse
function `S(id)` such that it returns the set that is associated with the given
identifier.

* `ID := {A..H}`
* `ID(s) := i` if `sRi`
* `S(i) := s` if `sRi`
* `ID(s)` is inverse to `S(i)`

## partial setup => partial order

```
S: a partial setup                             P: a partial order
=========================================  =>  ==================
|-A-------------------------------------|            A        |- superset-of
| |-B-----------| |-E-| |-F-----------| |         -------     |
| | |-C-| |-D-| | | 3 | | |-G-| |-H-| | |         B  E  F     |
| | | 1 | | 2 | | |---| | | 4 | | 5 | | |      ----     ----  |
| | |---| |---| |       | |---| |---| | |      C  D     G  H  |- subset-of
| |-------------|       |-------------| |
|---------------------------------------|
```

Using the above rooted setup `S`,
one can define a partial order over `S`.

* `P(S,<)` where ..
* `(a < b) := (a superset-of b) for (a,b in S)`

Since one can associate an id with each set,
one can also define a partial order over `ID`.

* `P(ID,<)` where `ID := {A..H}`
* `(ID(a) < ID(b)) := (a superset-of b) for (a,b in S)`

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## partial setup => node tree

Using the above rooted setup `S`,
one can directly define a node tree `T`,
such that each node is one of the above identifiers.

* `T(ID,E)` such that `ID := {A..H}` and ..
* `E := { (ID(a),ID(b)) | (a parent-of b) for (a,b in S) }`

Note that a partial setup has no other requirements that could be used to form
a node tree. That is, the only information available that can be used are the
relationships between the sets in `S`. Consequently, the resulting tree has
one node per set (i.e. `(#N == #S)`) rather than one node per element in `U(S)`
(i.e. `(#N != #U(S))` - 8 nodes, not 5 nodes). Put differently, a setup of `#S`
sets allows to form a node tree of `#S` nodes.

Note that one could enlarge the CSS of each set without changing the amount of
nodes and also without affecting the tree's structure. That is, even if the CSS
of each set would be a 2-element set, the resulting tree would still be as can
be seen above (i.e. a tree with `#S` nodes).

Note that, in order to increase the size of `css(s)` one needs to add the
additional elements to each set in `A*(s)`.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## partial setup =?=> node tree

Even though the relationship a node has with all the other nodes is defined
by those elements that are shared by the sets in `S`, the translation of
a set into a node is independent of these elements. That is,
**a setup does not embed any node definitions**.

As shown above, one can still associate a unique id with each set. However,
since the iteration over `S` is random, subsequent runs will yield trees that
have the same structure, but also trees that will in general differ in their
labels (i.e. their id values). Obviously, this randomness is insufficient since
the intention is to reliably recreate the exact same tree from a given setup.

The issue is therefore how to embed unique object/node identifiers such that
one can reliably determine the identifier that is associated with a particular
set and, based on that, the corresponding object/node. Further requirements
must therefore be introduced such that a setup can be understood to provide
the complete definition of a tree.

Based on the above, one available option is to provide a setup of sets as
**an ordered sequence of sets**. That is because the index-order can then be
understood to provide a unique id for each set - i.e. **an implicit embedding**.

Note that an implicit embedding allows the elements of each set to be of any
kind. That is, apart from having to maintain the relationships between the
sets, the elements can be chosen arbitrarily. Despite that, one is restricted
to index-based identifiers that are provided by the index-order of the ordered
sequence.

Since the elements in `U(S)` have no direct effect on the structure of the
resulting tree, a different option is to require that **each element** in `U`
is a node identifier. After all, each such element is a a characteristic element
and as such unique to the corresponding subset - i.e. **an explicit embedding**.

Note that an explicit embedding requires the elements in each set to represent
node references of some sort (e.g. an index into an ordered sequence of nodes).
Because of that, no index-order is required over the sets in a setup.
