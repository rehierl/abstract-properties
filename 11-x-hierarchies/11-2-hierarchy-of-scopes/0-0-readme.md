```
T <-> Hs
```

A tree (T) allows to from a hierarchy of scopes (Hs) such that the source tree
can be recreated from it. That is, each tree is isomorphic to a hierarchy of
scopes. Because of that, this isomorphism may be referred to as
**the T-Hs isomorphism**.

Note that, since a forest of trees is a union of disjoint trees, each forest
is isomorphic to a forest of scopes.

Note that a hierarchy of scopes is a rooted partial setup such that each set
in it has one and only one characteristic element CE (i.e. a rooted normalized
setup). Furthermore, the CE of each set is used as a node identifier. And since
each set corresponds with the scope of a node, such a specialized setup is
referred to as "a hierarchy of scopes".

Note that there is no child order over the childs sets in a hierarchy of scopes.
