# hierarchy of scopes

```
T <-> Hs
```

A tree (T) allows to from a hierarchy of scopes (Hs) such that the source tree
can be recreated based on the relationships between its scopes. That is, each
tree is isomorphic to a hierarchy of scopes. Because of that, this isomorphism
will be referred to as **the T-Hs isomorphism**.

Note that a hierarchy of scopes is a rooted partial setup such that each set
in it has one and only one characteristic element CE (i.e. a rooted normalized
setup). Furthermore, the CE of each set is used as a node reference. And since
each set corresponds with the scope of a node, such a specialized setup will
be referred to as "a hierarchy of scopes".

Note that, since a forest of trees is a union of disjoint trees, each forest
is isomorphic to a forest of scopes.
