# hierarchy of scopes (Hs)

```
T <-> Hs
```

A tree (T) allows to from a hierarchy of scopes (Hs) such that the source tree
can be recreated based on the relationships between its scopes. That is, each
tree is isomorphic to a hierarchy of scopes, which will referred to as
**the T-Hs isomorphism**.

Note that a hierarchy of scopes is a rooted partial setup of scopes such that
each set in it has one and only one characteristic element **CE** (i.e. a
rooted normalized setup). Furthermore, the CE of each set is used as a node
reference. And since each set corresponds with the scope of a node, such a
specialized setup will be referred to as "a hierarchy of scopes".

Note that, based on the Ht-Hs isomorphism, one can treat a hierarchy of scopes
(Hs) as being equivalent to a hierarchy of trees (Ht). Both constructs can
therefore be understood to express the same thing based on different syntactic
rules.
