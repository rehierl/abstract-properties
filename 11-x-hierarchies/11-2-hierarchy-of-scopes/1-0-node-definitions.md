# A partial setup (of sets)

Note that the focus of this discussion is on rooted setups that are isomorphic
to node trees. As such, these setups must embed (1) the definition of each
node, and also (2) the definition of the tree's structure.

Note that the definition of a node may be reduced to a node reference which
allows to lookup all the properties of the object a node represents. In case
of simiple numeric values, one can imagine an ordered sequence or a hashtable
of nodes which allows to retrieve the corresponding node object.

## unique identifiers

```
S: a partial setup                              S: a partial setup
=========================================  <=>  ======================
|-A-------------------------------------|       S := {
| |-B-----------| |-E-| |-F-----------| |        A: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },
| | |-C-| |-D-| | | 3 | | |-G-| |-H-| | |        B: { 1, 2          },
| | | 1 | | 2 | | |---| | | 4 | | 5 | | |        C: { 1             },
| | |---| |---| |       | |---| |---| | |        D: {    2          },
| |-------------|       |-------------| |        E: {       3       },
|---------------------------------------|        F: {          4, 5 },
                                                 G: {          4    },
                                                 H: {             5 } }
```

Note that, except for leaf sets, no set in the above setup has a characteristic
element. That is, the characteristic subsets of those sets that can be
identified by labels A, B, and F are empty.

* `(css(s) == Ã˜)` for `(s in {A,B,F})`

Since one can (randomly) iterate over the sets in `S`, and since each `(s in S)`
is distinct to every other set, one can define a set of identifiers `ID` such
that it holds a unique id for each set in `S`. Based on that, a binary relation
`R(S,ID,G)` that allows to lookup the unique `id` of each set, can be defined.

* `G(R) := { (s, ID(s)) | for (s in S) }`
* `G(R) := { .., ({2}, 'D'), .. }`

Based on being able to test simple sets for equality, one can define a bijective
function `ID(s)` such that it returns the id of the input set, and an inverse
function `S(id)` such that it returns the set that is associated with a given
identifier.

* `ID := {A..H}`
* `ID(s) := i` if `sRi`
* `S(i) := s` if `sRi`
* `ID(s)` is inverse to `S(i)`

## partial setup => partial order

```
S: a partial setup                             P: a partial order
=========================================  =>  ==================
|-A-------------------------------------|            A        |- superset-of
| |-B-----------| |-E-| |-F-----------| |         -------     |
| | |-C-| |-D-| | | 3 | | |-G-| |-H-| | |         B  E  F     |
| | | 1 | | 2 | | |---| | | 4 | | 5 | | |      ----     ----  |
| | |---| |---| |       | |---| |---| | |      C  D     G  H  |- subset-of
| |-------------|       |-------------| |
|---------------------------------------|
```

Using the above rooted setup `S`,
one can define a partial order over `S`.

* `P(S,<)` where ..
* `(a < b) := (a superset-of b) for (a,b in S)`

Since one can associate an identifier with each set,
one can also define a partial order over `ID`.

* `P(ID,<)` where `ID := {A..H}`
* `(ID(a) < ID(b)) := (a superset-of b) for (a,b in S)`

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## partial setup => node tree

Using the above rooted setup `S`, one can directly define a node tree `T`, such
that each node is represented by one of the above identifiers.

* `T(ID,E)` such that `ID := {A..H}` and ..
* `E := { (ID(a),ID(b)) | (a parent-of b) for (a,b in S) }`

Note that the only information available that can be used to form a tree order
are the relationships between the sets in `S`. Consequently, the resulting tree
has one node per set (i.e. `(#N == #S)`) rather than one node per element in
`U(S)` (i.e. 8 nodes, not 5 nodes). Put differently, a setup of `#S` sets
allows to form a tree of `#S` nodes.

Note that one could enlarge the CSS of each set without changing the amount of
nodes and also without affecting the tree's structure. That is, even if the CSS
of each set would be a 2-element set, the resulting tree would still be as can
be seen above (i.e. a tree with `#S` nodes).

Note that, in order to increase the size of `css(s)` one needs to add the
additional elements to each set in `A*(s)`.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## partial setup =?=> node tree

Even though the relationship a node has with all the other nodes is defined by
those elements that are shared by the sets in a setup, the translation of a set
into a node is independent of the elements themselves. That is, and without any
further requirement, **a setup does by itself not embed any node definitions**.

As shown above, one can still associate a unique id with each set. However,
since iterating over the sets in a setup is random, subsequent runs will
yield trees that have the same structure, but also trees that will in general
differ in their labels (i.e. their id values). Obviously, this randomness is
insufficient since the intention is to reliably recreate the exact same tree
from a given setup.

The issue is therefore how to embed unique node identifiers such that one can
reliably determine the identifier that is associated with a particular set and,
based on that, the corresponding node. Further requirements must therefore be
introduced such that a setup can be understood to provide the complete
definition of a tree.

Based on the above, one available option is to provide a setup of sets as
**an ordered sequence of sets**. That is because the index-order over its
components can then be understood to provide a unique identifier for each
set - i.e. **an implicit embedding**.

Note that an implicit embedding allows the elements of each set to be of any
kind. That is, apart from having to maintain the relationships between the
sets, the elements can be chosen arbitrarily. Despite that, one is bound to
index-based identifiers that are provided by the index-order of the ordered
sequence.

Note that an implicit embedding can be understood to encode **a child order**.
That is because the child order of each parent is then encoded as a suborder
to the ordered sequence.

Since the elements in the sets of a setup have no direct effect on the tree's
structure, a different option is to require that each such element must be a
node identifier. After all, each such element is a characteristic element and
as such unique to the corresponding subset - i.e. **an explicit embedding**.

Note that an explicit embedding by using specific characteristic elements
requires these elements to represent node references of some sort (e.g. an
index into an ordered sequence of node definitions).
