# about the description "reversed scope"

Note that the description of "reversed scopes" is in regards to their definition
as upward-closed open intervals (i.e. `[*,n]`) in contrary to the definiton of
default scopes as downward-closed open intervals (i.e. `[n,*]`). However, that
description is somewhat misleading since the actual scopes themselves are
"not reversed". If there were a more appropriate description ..

what would happen, if ..
- one would flip the orientation of an arborescence?
- superset-of turns into subset-of?
- and which nodes do the indcued subtrees hold?
