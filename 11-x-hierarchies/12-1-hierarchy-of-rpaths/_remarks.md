# hierarchy of rpaths
- obviously not any paths
- a family of rooted paths - rpaths

an old intuitive suspicion
- could result in a level-based encoding
- level, not depth .. depth(r)=0, level(r)=1
- allows for a non-tag based notation
  i.e. each node has a rank .. its node level
- in essence a sequence of rank values
- requires a pre-order trace of paths/scopes
