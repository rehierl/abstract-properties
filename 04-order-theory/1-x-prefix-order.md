prefix order
- generalizes the intuitive concept of a tree
- downward-total - if (a <= c) and (b <= c), then (a <= b) or (b <= a)
- i.e. "prefix" not as in "a sequence-based prefix"
- i.e. not an actual order example, but a characteristic
- i.e. an order is a prefix order, iff ...
- i.e. a strict poset that is downward-total
