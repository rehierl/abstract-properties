- a recap on order theory
- apart from a throgrough basic understanding,
  no in-depth knowledge of order theory is required
- the focus is on suborders of posets and tosets

# order theory

embedded as a suborder
- means - not as an element in the super-order
- "embedded" as a word isnt really required
- similar to a set "contains" another set
- i.e. either as an element, or as an embedded subset
- i.e. an explicit v.s. implicit containment
