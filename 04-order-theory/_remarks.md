- a recap on order theory
- apart from a throgrough basic understanding,
  no in-depth knowledge of order theory is required
- the focus is on suborders of posets and tosets

partial orders
- cover vertices with more than one incoming edge (?)
- if yes - will have to clarify - a tree corresponds
  with a partial order - since posets can then be
  said to cover more possibilities
- if yes, then prefixes and infixes may be disjoint
  to and even overlap each other
- if no, then prefixes may "only" be disjoint

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

Note that an ordered sequence can be described as a sequence of distinct
elements that is paired with a total order over its elements. The total order
over its elements is defined based upon the index order of the sequence.

Based on that, the description "ordered tree" does have quite the different
meaning. That is, an ordered set of nodes that is defined based upon the
partial order of that tree. That is, similar to "ordered sequence". That
is, "ordered tree" (tree + child order) is even more shullbit.
