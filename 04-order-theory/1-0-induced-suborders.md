"embedded as a suborder"
- means - not as an actual element in the super-order
- "embedded" as a word isnt strictly required
- similar to a set "contains" another set
- i.e. either as an element, or as an embedded subset
- i.e. an explicit v.s. implicit containment
- i.e. "contains" as in "integrated"
