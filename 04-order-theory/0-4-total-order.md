# total order

A ordered set `P := (V,R)` which is a (simple) partial order and, in addition
to that also **connex** can be described as an ordered set that is associated
with a **(simple) total/linear order** relation. Based on that, the ordered
set can itself be described as a (simple) total order, or as a
**(simple) loset** (i.e. a (simple) linearly ordered set), or as a
**(simple) toset** (i.e. a (simple) totally ordered set).

* a (simple) total/linear order is a connex simple partial order

A ordered set `P := (V,R)` which is a strict partial order and, in addition
to that also **connex** can be described as an ordered set that is associated
with a **strict total/linear order** relation. Based on that, the ordered
set can itself be described as a strict total order, or as a
**strict loset** (i.e. a strict linearly ordered set), or as a
**strict toset** (i.e. a strict totally ordered set).

* a strict total/linear order is a connex strict partial order
* a strict total/linear order is a trichotomous partial order
