- explain the concept of abstract properties based on fluid dynamics

fluid dynamics
- just a visual analogy
- to visualize certain trains of thoughts
- don't expect it to be overly accurate

river / waterfall
- gravity forces water to flow downwards
- i.e. along height differentials

remarks
- fluid dynamics as introduced here
- to introduce hierarchies based on
  maps of layers of discrete height
  stacked ontop of each other
