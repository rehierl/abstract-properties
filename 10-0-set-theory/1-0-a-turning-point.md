# a turning point

Each node tree `NT`, including path graphs, corresponds with a family of sets
that has certain characteristics. That is, a node tree can be transformed into
a family of scopes `FS`, and such a family of scopes allows to recreate the
node tree.

Because of that, any node tree can be described in terms of a family of scopes,
or in terms of another construct with which such a family corresponds (e.g.
an actual node order, the set of rooted paths `RP`). Because of that, any
conclusion derived from a family of scopes can be translated into the context
of node trees, and vice versa.

Consequently, any node tree can and should be seen to represent an ordered set
of elements, the same way we look at the set of natural numbers. There isn't
much of a difference. After all, a total order is defined as a specialized
partial order. That is, partial orders are the default, not some odd "thing"
that can be ignored just because we might think we don't need them.

Sure, if some current context can be restricted to a few square meters, one can
model our world as having a flat surface. After all, if ones area of concern is
limited enough, then earth's curvature can be neglected. However, that point of
view, as "good enough" at it might seem in a given context, is from a wider
perspective just "not good enough". Even worse, rejecting the widened point of
view on a global scale has the effect of keeping us from having to accept that
there is more .. a lot more.

The difference between total orders and partial orders is similar since flat
documents will only get us to a certain point. After that, one can not do
without a widened order/set-based perspective.

Each node tree is isomorphic to a family of scopes. Because of that, one can not
only focus on tags/markup, and maybe even Graph Theory (GT), since one must also
accept the rules of Order Theory (OT), Category Theory (CT) and even Set Theory
(ST). That is, if you want to end up with a solution that can be guaranteed to
get the job done, then there is only one true option available:

Accept it for what it is.
