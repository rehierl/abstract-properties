# set theory (ST)

Due to my personal lack of experience in regards to more abstract aspects in
the field of Set theory (i.e. those that go beyond the area of naive set theory)
I still have difficulties in dealing with it the same way as with Graph theory
(GT) and (to some extent) Order theory (OT). After all, I am still a common
mortal whose level of understanding only increases one small step at a time.

Note that this chapter is similar to the chapter on Category theory (CT).
It mainly serves as a pointer to a particular area of Mathematics (i.e.
Set theory ST), which is overall a higher level of abstraction and as such
fundamental to the overall discussion.

## (naive) set theory (NST)

Thus far, it should be obvious that Mathematics is a lot more than just about
numbers or functions. After all, in all previous chapters there have hardly
been any arithmetic calculations (if any at all). Instead, the focus of those
chapters was on sets of elements, and the relationships between these sets,
defined in terms of graphs and orders. Because of that, most definitions used
in naive set theory have already been introduced and used throughout previous
chapters.

That is, sets of elements have been defined informally using natural language,
or in terms of the set-builder notation. Also, operations on sets have been
defined using more or less informal means. These are methods most of us should
have already been familiar with from basic introductions to Mathematics.

* set-builder notaiton: `S := { x | x has property P }`
* element membership (i.e. contains)
* equal, unequal, distinct
* (proper) superset-/subset-of
* union, intersection, disjoint
* set difference, symmetric difference
* power set

Despite that, the focus of previous chapters was not on concrete sets of
elements, but rather on their use as abstract containers and to define
complex/composite constructs such as endo-relations.

## (axiomatic) set theory (AST)

AST takes NST to the next level of abstraction. That is because AST is mostly
concerned with objects that are relevant to mathematics as a whole. As such,
AST is, similar to CT, used as a foundational system of mathematics.

Note that trees in AST are seen as partially ordered sets that have certain
requirements associated with them. (hint - a family of scopes).

## (descriptive) set theory (DST)

The focus of DST is, amongst others, on certain classes of "well-behaved"
subsets of real numbers. As such, it is a main area of research in ST.

Note that trees in DST are seen as collections of sequences such that every
prefix of a sequence in it also belongs to the collection. As such, and even
in DST, trees are seen as partially ordered sets that have certain
requirements associated with them. (hint - the set of all rooted paths).
