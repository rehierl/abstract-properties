# (axiomatic) set theory (ST)

Note that this chapter is similar to the chapter on Category theory (CT).
It serves as a mere pointer to a particular area of Mathematics (i.e. Set
theory ST), which seems to be remotely relevant to this discussion. Due
to my personal lack of knowledge, I can't seem to figure out what exactly
that relevance is.

Note that, instead of introducing some aspect to the current discussion, this
chapter needs to be understood to mark a turning point in the course of this
discussion, as described below.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## (naive) set theory

Thus far, it should be obvious that that Mathematics is a lot more than just
about numbers or functions. After all, in all the chapters before there have
hardly been any arithmetic calculations (if at all). Instead, the focus of
that content was on sets of elements, and the relationships between these sets
defined in terms of graphs and orders. Because of that, most definitions used
in **naive** set theory have already been provided and used throughout the
previous chapters.

That is, sets of elements have been defined informally using natural language,
or in terms of the set-builder notation. Also, operations on sets have been
defined using more or less informal means. These are methods most of us should
be familiar with from basic introductions to Mathematics.

* set-builder notaiton: `S := { x | x has property P }`
* element membership (i.e. contains)
* equal, unequal, distinct
* (proper) superset-/subset-of
* union, intersection, disjoint
* set difference, symmetric difference
* power set

Despite that, the focus of previous chapters was not on concrete sets of
elements, but rather on their use as abstract containers and to define
relationships between complex constructs such as endo-relations.

## (axiomatic) set theory

Set theory takes this level of abstraction even further since (axiomatic) set
theory is mostly concerned with objects that are relevant to mathemtics as a
whole. As such, set theory is (similar to category theory) used as a
foundational system of mathematics.

One can tell how substantial that is based on the most recent conclusion that
might have gone unnoticed, and which will therefore be described below.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## a turning point

How fundamental sets of elements are to Mathematics can be seen by the most
recent conclusion, which one might have noticed as one conclusion of many:

Each node tree, including path graphs, corresponds with a family of sets that
has certain characteristics. That is, a node tree can be transformed into a
family of scopes, and such a family of scopes allows to recreate the node tree.

Because of that, any node tree can be described in terms of a family of scopes,
or in terms of another construct with which such a family corresponds (e.g. an
actual node order). Because of that, any conclusion derived from a family of
scopes can be translated into the context of node trees, and vice versa.

Consequently, any node tree can and should be seen to represent an ordered set
of elements, the same way we look at the set of natural numbers. There isn't
much of a difference. After all, a total order is nothing more but a specialized
partial order. That is, partial orders are the default, not some odd "thing"
that can be completely ignored just because we think we don't need them.

Sure, if some current context is limited to a few square meters, one can model
our world as having a flat surface. After all, if ones area of concern is
restricted enough, then earth's curvature can be neglected. However, that point
of view, as "good enough" at it might seem in a given context, is from a wider
point of view just "not good enough".

The difference between total orders and partial orders is similar to that
because flat/total documents will only get you to a certain point. After
that, one simply needs a wider, an order-based perspective.

Each node tree can be expressed in terms of a family of sets
