# family of scopes

* must be rooted normalized setup
* must explain that a family of scopes
  is a rooted normalized setup
* define "tree/forest of scopes"

Note that there is no order amongst the child sets in a setup. That is, a setup
would need to have additional characteristics which could then be used to define
a child order over the sets within a setup. - e.g. a sequence of sets

An unordered tree allows to from a normalized hierarchy of sets such that the
initial tree can be formed from it. Likewise, a normalized hierarchy of sets
allows to form an unordered tree, which in turn allows to form the initial
hierarchy. That is, each unordered tree corresponds with a normalized hierarchy
of sets. And since an unordered forest is the disjoint union of unordered trees,
each such forest corresponds with a normalized hierarchy/forest of sets.
