# family of scopes
- a chapter on families of scopes
- a set-/order-based point of view
- see - axiomatic set theory (AST)

proof (NT <-> FS)
- alternative definitions for graph-based terms
  possible - e.g. least/greatest, ...
- flesh out some definitions

disjoint eq. incomparable
- if "disjoint" is the only valid alternative
  to "related", then yes - equivalent
- note - disjoint has no orientation
- i.e. disjoint will drop information
