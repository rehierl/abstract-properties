By the placement of headings, content is grouped into sections. Because of that,
authors use structural relationships to express which nodes belong to a section,
and which ones don't.

At this point one can only clearly state that no node above a heading belongs
to the section of a heading. Even though a section is in general assumed to
consist of consecutive nodes (i.e. no gaps), no such clear statement can be
made about where or when the section of a heading ends.

A document that has one heading only, combined with the general agreement that
the section of such a heading includes all the nodes that are beneath it, does
seem to suggest that a formal definition is possible in regards to the default
scope of a section.

The total node order of a document can be referred to as the document order,
or as the above-of or the below-of node order. The latter since that order can
be used to determine if a node is above or below a heading.

Since a section is a sequence of consecutive nodes in regards to the document
order, the section of a heading can be described as a substring of nodes to
the document order. In addition to that, and because a section consists of
distinct nodes, a section corresponds with a total suborder that is embedded
into the document order.

A clear understanding of the document order is therefore essential. This does
in turn suggest that Mathematics - in particular Order Theory and Graph Theory
- can and must be used to clarify when and why a section does end.
