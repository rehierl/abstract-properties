## empty

An endo-Relation `R` can be described as being empty (in the sense that it
does not define any relationships), if its set of edges is empty. Based on
that, will be referred to as using the symbol of an empty set (i.e. `Ø`).

* `(is-empty R) := (G == Ø)`

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## contains

An endo-relation `R` is said to contain the endo-relation `S`, if all the
elements within both sets of `S` are elements in the corresponding set in `R`:

* `R := (D,G)`, `S := (T,U)`
* `(R contains S) := (T subset-of D) and (U subset-of G)`

Note that either of the sets in `S` may be equal to the corresponding set in
`R`. If only a disconnected vertex was removed from `R`, then `(T == D)` is
true. If however only one or more edges were removed, then `(U == G)` is true.
That is, if an edge is to be removed along with its endpoints, then its
endpoints need to be removed explicitly.

## restriction - R(T)

A relation `S` is said to be a restriction of a known relation `R`, if its set
of vertices `T` is a (strict) subset to the set of vertices `D` in `R`, and if
`S` contains all the edges from `R` whose endpoints are in `T`.

* `S := R(T) := { (a,b) | aRb and (a,b in T) }`

Note that `(T subset-of D)` and `(U subset-of G)` are both true. However, `T`
is in general a strict subset of `D` since one would otherwise end up with `S`
being equal to `R`. In contrary to that, `U` is in general not necessarily a
strict subset to `G` (e.g. if only disconnected vertices were removed from `D`).

Note that this operation can be understood to be similar to the operation that
is used to form an **induced subtree**. That is, given an input node (as the
root node of the induced subtree `T[r]`) all the descendants of that node need
to be determined first. Hence, one first determines a subset of nodes and then
the edges that belong to the induced subtree. As such, the term **induced** can
be understood to be associated with well defined rules that need to be applied
based on the given input information.

Note that this operation can be understood to be similar to the **subset-of**
operator in the context of sets of elements such that simple sets of elements
have no further information that could be added.

As such, a restriction can be described to form **an induced sub-relation**
based on a pre-determined subset of vertices. Hence, one could speak of an
induced sub-relation `R[v]`, if the subset of vertices were defined based on
a given single vertex - i.e. in terms of all those vertices that can be reached
from that initial vertex.

## sub-relation

Note that no direct counterpart to the subset-of operator will be provided
at this point. The reason is that specialized relations (such as trees and
order relations) should provide a specialized definition.

- TODO - It is at this point too unclear, if these specialized definitions
are similar to some extend, or differ substantially in some specific way.
Will have to spend some thought on that aspect once these definitions have
been fleshed out.
