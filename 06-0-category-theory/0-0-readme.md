warning
- take the following with a grain of salt .. a lot of salt
- im not (yet) mathematician enough to flesh it out
- my mind just keeps going .. "that's it, i'm outta here"

intention
- if it is a mere skeletton of a chapter, then why keep it?
- if you have a "gut feeling" about something, then there are two options
- 1) scrap it - because it doesn't seem to amount to anything reliable
- 2) keep it - because it kept popping up into your mind for a reason
- the difference - if you can't determine yourself whether or not it is
  actually of any use, then maybe others can - if others can point out
  that it is of no use, then so what, one can still scrap it - if others
  can use that "pointer" as an inspiration to take it to the next level,
  then others don't have to waste their time to rethink the same thought
- the key - point out that it is barebone and that you just don't know
  what to do with it - scrapping it would be like acting as if the
  "problem" doesn't exist

used for
- graphs with labeled edges
- each edge is labeled with a bijective function
- each such function represents an isomorphic transformation
