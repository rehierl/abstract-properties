we do treat lists and trees differently
- even though we should not (!)
- e.g. the removal of an item type-0 vs. type-1 scopes
- also in regards to our overall perception
- lists - we do have some sense of order
- trees - in general no such perception
- visualize using paths/trees
- i.e. rotate a top-down tree by 90Â° counter-clock wise
- point out that there is not much difference
- could do as an introductory "pointer"
