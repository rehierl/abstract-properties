By the placement of a heading content is grouped into the heading's section.
Because of that, structural relationships are used to express which nodes
belong to a section, and which ones don't.

At this point one can however only clearly state that no node above a heading
belongs to the heading's section. Even though a section is in general assumed
to consist of consecutive nodes (i.e. no gaps), no such clear statement can
be made about where or when a section does end.

A document that has one heading only, combined with the general agreement that
the section of such a heading includes all the nodes that are beneath it, does
seem to suggest that a clear definition is possible in regards to the default
scope of a section.

The total node order of a document can be referred to as the document order or
as the above/below node order. The latter since that node order can initially
be used to determine if a node is above or below a heading.

Since a section is a sequence of consecutive nodes in regards to the document
order, the section of a heading can be described as a substring of nodes. In
addition to that, and because a section consists of distinct nodes, a section
corresponds with a total suborder that is embedded into the document order.

A clear understanding of the document order is therefore essential. This does
in turn suggest that Mathematics - in particular Order Theory and Graph Theory
- can and must be used to clarify when a section does end.
