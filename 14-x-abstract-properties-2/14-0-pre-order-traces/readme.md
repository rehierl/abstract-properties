# types of scopes / pre-order traces

This chapter will shift one's focus from a node and its descendants (i.e.
`(n × c)`) towards a node and its subsequent siblings, while including all
of the descendants (i.e. `(n × c × s)`). The following should therefore be
understood as an attempt to widen one's perspective on the inner structure
of pre-order traces.
