a chapter on families of rooted paths
- a set-/order-based point of view
- alternative definitions for graph-based terms
- see descriptive set theory (DST)

an old intuitive suspicion
- could result in a depth-based encoding
- equivalent to family of scopes?
- a prefix order ?

remarks
- alternative definitions for graph-based terms
  e.g. least/greatest, ...
- proof (NT <-> RP)

wikipedia: tree in dst <-> tree in order-theory
- every dst-tree is also an ot-tree
- has one minimal element
- each element has a well-ordered set of predecessors
- (a < b) := (a proper-prefix-of b)
- the empty sequence is the unique minimal element
- an ot-tree may be represented by an isomorphic tree of sequences
