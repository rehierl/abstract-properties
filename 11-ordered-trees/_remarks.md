remarks
- explicitly add the child order of an ordered tree to its tree order
- this will result in the true node order of an ordered tree
- referred to as a (partial) extension of the tree order

point out the confusing situation
- by default names remain in regards to the unordered tree
- if in doubt use patterns - e.g. "a node's former subsequent sibling"
