- we describe sets that have an order associated with
  them, as "ordered sets of elements"
  i.e. an order over all the elements within that set,
  i.e. not just certain parts of it
- in that regards, "ordered tree" makes more sense
- in that regards, almost synonymous to "directed tree"
- the issue - "directed tree" focusses on visuals,
  i.e. the orientation of arrows
- in that regards, using "ordered tree" to point out
  that it is about a "partially ordered set" - a poset
  that can be visualized using a node tree
- i.e. similar to "ordered sequence"
- in that regards, using "unordered tree" to point out
  that the edges are undirected and as such do not
  define an actual order of nodes
- i.e. all the nodes of an "unordered tree" appear to
  be equivalent - i.e. similar to describing set of
  elements as "a simple set", or as an "unordered set"

since the use of "ordered tree" is screwed up
- one should explicitly describe that construct as
  "a tree that has a child order associated with it"
- that is long and ugly - as it should be
- an "ordered tree" corresponds with a partial order
- as a simplification, one should provide alternative
  descriptions - such as "document tree" - which, once
  defined, make clear what the context is

a possible issue
- first child, last child, next sibling
- well, that "child order" is still a suborder
  to the true node order of a node tree
  that has a child order associated with it
