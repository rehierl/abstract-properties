# family of trees

proof (NT <-> induced subtrees)
a tree corresponds with a hierarchy of sets
- here - a tree corresponds with a hierarchy of trees
- can still be used as an example for orders
  that can be formed from a tree
- can still be used to point out that a
  hierarchy/family of sets is itself hierarchical
- i.e. a set and all its subsets in that family
  corresponds with a subtree
- as such - not without any value
