By the placement of a heading content is grouped into the heading's section.
Structural relationships are therefore used to express which nodes belong to
a section, and which ones don't.

The total node order of a document can be referred to as the document order.
In addition to that, and because that node order initially allows to determine
if a node is above or below a heading, it will also be referred to as the
above/below node order.

At this point one can only clearly state that no node above a heading belongs
to the section of that heading. Even though a section is in general assumed to
consist of consecutive nodes (i.e. no gaps), no clear statement can be made in
general about where or when a section does end. A document that has one heading
only, combined with the general agreement that the section of such a heading
includes all the nodes that are beneath it, does however seem to suggest that
a clear definition is possible in regards to the default scope of a section.

Since a section is a consecutive sequence of nodes in regards to the document
order, the section of a heading can be described as a substring of nodes to
that node order. Furthermore, and because a section consists of distinct nodes,
a section corresponds with a total suborder that is embedded into the document
order. Consequently, a clear understanding of the document order is essential
in order to clearly define where a section ends.

Due to the above Mathematics (in particular Graph Theory and Order Theory) must
be used in order to clarify at what point the section of a heading does end.
