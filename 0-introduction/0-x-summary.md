By the placement of headings content is grouped into sections. Structural
relationships are therefore used to express which nodes belong to a section,
and which ones don't.

The total node order of a document can be referred to as the document order.
In addition to that, and because that node order allows to determine if a node
is above or below a heading, it will also be referred to as the above/below
node order.

At this point one can only clearly state that no node above a heading belongs
to the section of that heading. Even though a section is in general assumed to
consist of consecutive nodes (i.e. no gaps), no clear statement can be made in
general about where or when a section does end. A document that has one heading
only, combined with the general agreement that the section of that heading
includes all the nodes that are beneath it, does however seem to suggest that
a clear definition is possible for the default scope of a section.

Since a section is a consecutive sequence of nodes in regards to the document
order, the section of a heading can be described as a substring of nodes to
that node order. Furthermore, and because a section consists of distinct nodes
only, a section corresponds with a total suborder that is embedded into the
document order. Consequently, a clear understanding of the document order is
essential.

All of the above does suggest that Mathematics (in particular Graph Theory and
Order Theory) must be used in order to clarify at what point the section of a
heading does end. Because of that, there is no direct simple answer.
