# hierarchy of scopes
- the (scopes <-> trees) correspondence

A tree allows to from a hierarchy of scopes such that the source tree can be
recreated from it. Likewise, a hierarchy of scopes allows to form an tree,
which in turn allows to form the source hierarchy. That is, each tree is
isomorphic to a hierarchy of scopes. And since a forest of trees is the
disjoint union of trees, each such forest corresponds with a forest of scopes.

Note that there is no order amongst the child sets in a setup. That is, a
setup would need to have additional characteristics which could then be used
to define a child order over the sets in a setup. - e.g. an ordered sequence
of sets.
