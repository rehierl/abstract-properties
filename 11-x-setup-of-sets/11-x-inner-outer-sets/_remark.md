# inner/outer sets, border graph/edges

no longer relevant
- taken from the old top-down approach
- similar to drawing lines beneath an ordered sequence
- except for the visual approach

general remark
- this was written before focussing on actual node orders
- i.e. while still focussing on a tree's "visual" structure
- hint - focus on border lines that surround the corresponding nodes
- note - `ON(n) != OS(n)` - quite different actually
- note - "border edge" refers to inner/outer sets - i.e. will have to update

allows for explanations that are more visual
- draw boxes around induced subtrees
- hence - inner/outer set of nodes, border edges
- visually transition from subtrees to sets of nodes
- i.e. a non-scope/property based approach
- would have to argue based on relationships
  between trees rather than the rel between sets
- however - the set of nodes of each subtree
