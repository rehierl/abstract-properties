# node trees / operations
- the definition of operation as an application of generic properties
- i.e. in regards to defining the scope of an operation
- builds upon the definition of scopes - i.e. "scope x of node y"
- remove = always the removal of an entire suffix/intervall
  in regards to the appropriate node order

point out the difference in default cases
- in regards to the removal of an item
- total/sequences - defaults to type-0 scopes
- partial/trees - defaults to type-1 scopes
- we do treat sequences and trees differently
