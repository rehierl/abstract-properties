# types of scopes / pre-order traces

This chapter provides further insight into the inner structure of pre-order
traces. Furthermore, this chapter will shift the focus from a node and its
descendants (i.e. `(n × c)`) towards a node and its subsequent siblings,
while implicitly including all of their descendants (i.e. `(n × c × s)`).

The following should therefore be understood as an attempt to widen one's
perspective on pre-order traces.
