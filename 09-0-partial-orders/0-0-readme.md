# partial orders

This chapter describes transformations that transform one construct `ci` into
another construct `cj` such that the formed construct `cj` can be reversed back
into `ci`. Because of that, `ci` can be said to be **isomorphic** to `cj`.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## isomorphisms

The isomorphisms described in this chapter can be visualized as follows.

```
T <-> Q <-> P <-> S
|<--------->|
```

* `T` - node trees
* `Q` - partial orders of nodes
* `P` - partial orders of scopes
* `S` - (partial) families of scopes
