family of scopes
-> node tree
-> family of scopes

remarks
- intended to formalize the notion of "hierarchy of scopes"
- aka. "scope order"

remarks
- provide order-based definitions for the well-known
  path-based definitions

some-of as a composed quantifier
- relevant beginning with partial orders
- some-of := all-of, but none-of
- an interval-based point of view
- some-of := (a,*) \ (b,*)
