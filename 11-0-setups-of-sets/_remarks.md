## the transitive reduction of a poset

```
v1 -> v2
v3
```

* may have disconnected vertices

```
     |-> v2 ->|
v1 ->|        |-> v4
     |-> v3 ->|
```

* may have incomparable vertices
* any vertex may have any number of incoming edges
* any vertex may have any number of outgoing edges

```
v1 ->|-> v3
v2 ->|
```

* may have any number of source vertices

```
v1 ->|-> v3
     |-> v4
```

* may have any number of leaf vertices
