# the things we know

- TODO - it is about to get confusing ..
- the words we use are in regards to the "things" we know
- but how does one describe what one does not know?
- how does one describe what is "new"
- with words that are defined for things that are not new?
- by using the words we do know and by that redefine their meaning
- so at first - it won't work without confusing others
