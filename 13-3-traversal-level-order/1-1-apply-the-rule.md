## applied to one node only

Analogous to the pre-order trace, the resulting sequence can be described
as a new sequence of siblings and therefore also to replace a node's former
sequence of subsequent siblings.

```
n.s = (n.s Ã— n.c)
n.c = null
```

With that in mind, a node can be treated as having no more child nodes, which
is why the level-order rule can also be understood to remove all child nodes
by turning them into subsequent siblings of their former parent. Because of
that, the level-order rule can also be said to push the child nodes of a node,
including all of their descendants, one level closer towards the root.

Note that, if a node is a leaf, then even the level-order rule will have no
effect on it. Likewise, a node that had subsequent siblings, but no child nodes
will remain unchanged. In contrary to that, a node that had child nodes, but
no subsequent siblings will have its sequence of (former) child nodes as its
new sequence of subsequent siblings.

Note that, in this context, a missing sequence can be treated as being
equivalent to an empty sequence (i.e. no null-reference error).

## applied to all the nodes => a path graph

( The following is in regards to applying the level-order rule to all the nodes
with no overall order of execution in mind. Also recall that the focus is on
reducing the number of leaf nodes to one leaf only. )

```
n -> (ns .. ls) -> (fc .. lc)
      |..   |?      |..   |..
```

Since the former first child `fc` of node `n` is appended to its former last
sibling `ls`, node `fc` is set as the next sibling of `ls`. Because of that,
`ls` becomes the previous sibling of `fc`.

If `ls` has no child in the unordered doctree (i.e. a leaf), then `ls` is also
a leaf in the ordered doctree (i.e. has no subsequent sibling and no child).
The level-order rule has therefore the effect of turning a leaf node into one
that is no last sibling to any node and therefore also **no longer a leaf**.

If `ls` has a child in the unordered doctree (i.e. a parent), then it remains
to be a parent that has `fc` as its next sibling. The level-order rule therefore
also applies to `ls`, which will append its child nodes to `lc`. That is, if
the rule were to be applied to `ls` just after applying it to `n`.

The level-order rule has in general the effect of turning nodes into siblings
that, apart from their next subsequent sibling, have **no child nodes**.

```
root -> (fc .. lc)
```

Since an unordered doctree is in general assumed to have two or more nodes,
the level-order rule will turn the root's first child `fc` into its next, and
the root's last child `lc` into its last sibling `ls`. After that, the root
and its child nodes can be understood to represent a sequence of siblings.

```
root -> (ns .. ls) -> (fc .. lc)?
```

Similar to before, if `ls` (i.e. the root's former last child) has no child
in the unordered doctree (i.e. there is no `c := (fc .. lc)`), then it also
won't have a child in the ordered doctree. In that case, the last subsequent
sibling of the root **remains to be a leaf**.

If `ls` has a child in the unordered doctree, then the pre-order rule also
applies to `ls`, which will turn `ls` into a node that has its former first
child `fc` as its next and its former last child `lc` as its last sibling.
Because of that, the former last child `lc` of `ls` becomes the root's new
last sibling `ls`. (Rinse and repeat until `ls` is a leaf).

Note that, after applying the level-order rule to the root, the rule may be
applied to any number of different nodes, before applying it to the root's
last sibling `ls`. In such a case, `ls` is not necessarily the root's last
child, but may be the former last child of another node instead. Because of
that, an order of execution must be defined.

Applying the level-order rule to all the nodes in an ordered tree will turn
an ordered doctree into **a path graph** that has the last child node of a
child order as its one and only leaf.
