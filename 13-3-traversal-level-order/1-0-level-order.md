# the (default) level-order tree traversal

```
//- the default level-order tree traversal
traverseBFS(root) begin
  queue = new Queue()
  queue.enqueue(root)

  while (not queue.isEmpty) begin
    node = queue.dequeue()
    visit(node)

    for (child in node.childNodes) begin
      queue.enqueue(child)
    end
  end
end
```

Note that the level-order traversal trace begins with the tree's root, continues
with the root's child nodes, followed by the child nodes of these child nodes,
and so on. As such, the (default) level-order trace contains the nodes in tree
order (i.e. ancestors before descendants) and also in child order (if it exists).
Because of that, the level-order trace is **order-preserving**.

```
n -|-> (ns .. ls)     =>     n -> (ns .. ls) -> (fc .. lc)
   |-> (fc .. lc)            n -> s -> c
```

Due to the above, **the level-order rule** requires to first embed a child order
(even if only temporary), and then to append the sequence of child nodes `c(n)`
to the sequence of subsequent siblings `s(n)`. Because of that, and unlike the
embedding of a child order, the pre-order rule does not build upon pre-existing
edges.

* the pre-order rule := `n -> (s Ã— c)`

Note that, since a (P)arent appears before its subsequent (S)iblings and they
before the parent's (D)escendants, the level-order rule may also be referred
to as **the PSD rule/pattern** (aka. `p -> s -> d`).

Note that the level-order tree traversal is included as a dual counterpart to
the pre-order rule. However, even though it is order-preserving, it is not in
the focus of this discussion. That is because it does not keep a node and its
descendants in close proximity.

Note that, since the level-order rule does not keep a node and its descendants
in close proximity, **a particular order of execution is required** (see below).

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## order of execution

As pointed out above, the (default) level-order trace is **order preserving**
since it is effectively a sequence of concatenated child orders. However,
and since the child order of a node will be appended to the end of the node's
sequence of subsequent siblings, the order in which the level-order rule is
applied, is relevant. That is because different orders of execution result
in different sequences of child orders and, because of that, in distinct
level-order traces. Consequently, a default order of execution must be defined.

Note that the child orders on a node level may be ordered in random order
without producing a conflict with tree's tree's node order and even without
producing a conflict with the tree's child order. After all, the child orders
will be appended as whole units. (Based on that, the level-order trace of a
tree may be described as **a sequence of child orders**).

Note that this seems to suggest that the level-order rule is **incomplete**
to some extent. That is, the rule does by itself not turn all the nodes of
an ordered doctree into comparable nodes. After all, incomparable nodes can
be ordered arbitrarily without contradiction.

TODO - An open issue - What exactly does the level-order rule not cover?
The question is which means a doctree does provide that can be used for
a more generic definition of the order of execution?

**The default order of execution** is as follows:

The level-order rule must be first applied to the tree's root, which will append
the root's child order as the next child order to be processed. After that, the
level-order rule must be applied to the child nodes of the tree's root in the
order as specified by the root's child order. Because of that, a tree's child
order can be said to carry over to the order of child orders in the level-order
trace.

Note that, defined as such, the order of execution can be described as being
defined **in order of appearance of the nodes in each child order**. Because
of that, the default order of execution builds upon the total order of each
child order.

Note that, because of this default order of esecution, the level-order rule
**can not be applied concurrently**. The question is, if there could be an
order of exectuion which whould allow concurrency (e.g. by dropping the
requirement of a well defined order of child orders).
