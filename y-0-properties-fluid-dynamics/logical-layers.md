- colors, logical layers

crimson creeper
- existing creeper is at certain points injected with an additional property
- one that make the creeper immune to guns and mortars
- that property is added to the creeper, it isn't a different creeper
  that replaces the old one
- visualized by adding a pink color to the creeper
- the fluid dynamics continue seamlessly
- like using smoke to visualize aerodynamics

in addition to
- not isolated to that particular layer
- to some extent hereditary to further levels
- in general - other possibility - replacement,
  here not the case/focus
- here like the (+1) height differential of that layer

defining sections
- like marking a layer and all further layers with a color
- all belong to that section

hierarchies of sections
- mark node levels as logically relevant
- allow to focus on a reduced number of layers
- each marked layer - seen as holding its own content

hierarchies of documents
- certain layers - seen as holding its own document
