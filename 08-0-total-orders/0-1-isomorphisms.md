The isomorphisms described in this chapter are
visualized below as two-headed arrows (`<->`).

```
s <-> p <-> P <-> Q
      |<--------->|
```

* `s` - an ordered sequence
* `p` - a path graph of (distinct) nodes
* `P` - a total order of scopes
* `Q` - a total order of nodes

Note that, since `p` is isomorphic to `P`, and since `P` is isomorphic to `Q`,
one can conclude that the existence of the isomorphism between `p` and `Q` is
**a matter of consequence**. Because of that, future discussions will focus on
significant isomorphisms and skip those that are less important to the overall
discussion.

Note that this chapter is excessive in the amount of transformations that are
being described, and intentionally inaccurate in regards to many explanations.
Because of that, this chapter is intended to introduce basic concepts of what
will be clarified in regards to partial orders.
