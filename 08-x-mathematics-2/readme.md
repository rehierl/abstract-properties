Similar to the chapter on Category Theory (CT), this meta chapter contains
a chapter on **Set Theory (ST)**. The core focus of that chapter is to point
out that **axiomatic set theory (AST)** and **descriptive set theory (DST)**
have their own ways to describe trees.

Note that AST sees trees as partially ordered sets of vertices. In contrary
to that, DST sees trees as prefix-based collections of sequences. Both of
these points of views can loosely be described as being closely related to
the rooted paths in the context of node trees.

Note that the perception of AST and DST on trees can be described as
**a turning point**. That is, node trees, generalized as **hierarchies**,
can be described from different perspectives, which allows to proof certain
aspects based on one perspective or another.

This meta chapter closes with a second chapter on **Order Theory (OT)**,
which extends the previous chapter on that topic by definitions that are
relevant to the overall discussion (e.g. **downward-total**).
