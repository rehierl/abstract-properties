# mathematics / order theory

This chapter extends the previous chapter on order theory by definitions that
are relevant to hierarchies.

* well-founded relation, well-order
* downward/upward-total

Note that the orientation of these definitions results from mathematics having
its focus on the abstract values of numbers. That is, "down" is oriented towards
those numbers whose abstract value is smaller.

Note that the "down" is, in the context of node trees oriented towards leaf
nodes, which are in general drawn beneath the tree's root in a top-to-bottom
fashion. Because of that, the general understanding of "up" in the context of
node trees is oriented towards the root at the very top.

Note that this general **naming conflict** can not be resolved, which is why
one has to choose one orientation over the other. Since the overall focus of
this discussion is on abstract properties wose scopes are defined as intervals
over node orders, the perspective of this discussion will hold on to
**the value-based perspective**.
