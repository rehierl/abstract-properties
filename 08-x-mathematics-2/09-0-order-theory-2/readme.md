# mathematics / order theory

This chapter extends the previous chapter on order theory by definitions
that are relevant to hierarchies.

* well-founded relation, well-order
* downward-total, upward-total

Note that the orientation of these definitions results from mathematics
having its focus on the abstract values of numbers. That is, "down" is
oriented towards those numbers whose abstract value is smaller. This
orientation may be referred to as **the value-based orientation**.

Note that "down" in the context of node trees is oriented towards leaf nodes,
which are in general visualized below the tree's root in a top-to-bottom
fashion. That is, the general understanding of "up" in the context of node
trees is oriented towards the root at the very top. This orientation may be
referred to as **the visual-based orientation**.

Note that both perspectives can be seen as a **naming conflict** since the
value-based notion of "up" is consistent with the visual-based notion of
"down" in the context of node trees. Because of that, one must choose one
orientation over the other.

Since the overall focus of this discussion is on abstract properties whose
scopes are defined as intervals over node orders, the perspective of this
discussion will hold on to **the value-based perspective**. A tree order
must therefore be understood to be downward-total, not upward-total.
