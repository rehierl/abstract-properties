# trees in set theory (ST)

- a short summary on trees in ST

trees in descriptive ST
- a collection of (ordered) sequences
- each prefix of every sequence
  must also be a sequence in the tree
- note - ordered by "prefix-of"

trees P(T,<) in axiomatic ST
- ht(t) := { (s in T) | (s < t) } is well-ordered
- well-ordered := total + each subset hat a least
- note - ht() decreases in size towards the root
- note - ht() corresponds with a rooted path
- note - somewhat similar "but inverse" to scopes
- note - somewhat similar to downward-closed

remarks
- both concepts focus on prefixes
- larger numbers are more significant
- maths needs to deal with infinity
