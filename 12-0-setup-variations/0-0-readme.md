# setups of sets (2)

- thus far only one kind of related-to used
- i.e. superset-of

the goal ..
- find non-standard applications
- find possible variants

recall that ..
- an essential, a critical remark (!)
- you need to focus on the edges/paths
- focus on presequent/subsequent instead
- the elements themselves must be ignored
- root/parent/child - structural definitions
- independent of the related-to operator
- independent of types of elements
