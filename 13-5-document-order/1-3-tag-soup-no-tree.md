a tag soup ain't no (fucking) node tree
- a tag soup allows to read the scope of each node
- a node tree can be derived from that hierarchy of scopes
- the tag-based syntax is an application of generic
  properties, which is an application of order theory

Note that the start-tag of a node denotes **the characteristic element (CE)**
of the node's scope (i.e. the node itself).
