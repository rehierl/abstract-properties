when done
- recheck - maths / node trees / tree traversal

remarks
- "pre-order" in this context is not to be confused with
  the mathematical concept of "preorder" order relations
- "pre-order" is in regards to the pre-order tree traversal,
  i.e. in regards to its pre-order trace of nodes

remarks
- add the pre-order edges to the tree order of the ordered tree
- this will result in the pre-order trace of nodes
- referred to as a (linear) extension of the tree order
- explain the inner structure of the pre-order trace

remarks
- this is on a subtle level essential (!)
- the tags mislead to believe that a node
  corresponds with its tags and all its
  descendant nodes
- it does not (!)

remarks
- in pre-order is dominant
- child orders are sub-orders
- the reason why preorder is dominant
- order preserving in regards to all
  of the embedded suborders
- including any child order
