# tree traversal

topological sorting
- requires to be order-preserving?

remarks
- add the pre-order edges to the tree order of the ordered tree
- this will result in the pre-order trace of nodes
- referred to as a (linear) extension of the tree order
- explain the inner structure of the pre-order trace

remarks
- in pre-order is dominant
- child orders are sub-orders
- the reason why preorder is dominant
- order preserving in regards to all
  of the embedded suborders
- including any child order
level-order traversal
- also in pre-order
- however, a node and its child nodes
  are anyhting but in close proximity
