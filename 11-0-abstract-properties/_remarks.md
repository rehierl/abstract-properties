build upon the use of abstract properties
- in the context of ordered sequences (total orders)
- in the context of node trees (partial orders)

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## first

allow overlapping scopes?
- no - induced subtrees do not overlap each other
- related in a path graph
- disjoint exor related in a tree

gaps in a trace
- depens on the linear extension?
- pre- vs. post-order vs. other
- post-order is not order-preserving
- does not work with abstract properties

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## next

some-of as a composed quantifier
- relevant beginning with partial orders
- some-of := all-of, but none-of
- an interval-based point of view
- some-of := (a,*) \ (b,*)

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## meta/other

rooted paths
- a different system of order
- in contrary to the scope/containment order
- related ex-or overlap, never disjoint
- call it a prefix-order ?!?
- isomorphic to a node/scope order ?!?
