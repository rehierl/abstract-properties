- level vs. rank values
- an introduction to the interaction between abstract properties

level values as abstract properties
- decode/read as backwards-oriented instructions
- instructions to end/close the corresponding scopes
- level values count the number of open scopes
- if generated, they can be relied upon
- not much different to rank values
- level values are absolute

node levels as rank values
- a non-tag based notation
- a sequence of rank values

in regards to the level-based encoding
- Note the similarity with rank-based algorithms, which is
- because the current node, assuming all is in order, always
- is a child to one of the nodes in the current rooted path.
- detailed explanations will follow eventually
