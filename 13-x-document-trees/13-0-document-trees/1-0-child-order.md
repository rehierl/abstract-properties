# child order

As mentioned before, a tree `T(N,E)` is defined as a tuple of two simple sets:
A set of nodes `N` and a set edges `E` over `NÃ—N`. Based on that, any parent
`p` in a tree can be understood to be associated with a simple set of child
nodes `c(p)` which can be formed from `E`.

* `c(p) := { c | pEc }`
* `(c child-of p) := (c in c(p))`
* `(a sibling-of b) := (pEa and pEb)`

Based on the above, **no tree can be described as having a child order**.
That is because the set of child nodes of a parent is defined based on a
simple set of edges that does not define any order over the edges in it.

However, due to the limitations of real world applications, trees can only
be processed one node at a time. A tree can therefore be understood to have
an ordered sequence of nodes associated with it (aka. **a trace of nodes**),
which contains all the nodes of a tree in the order in which the nodes must
be processed.

* `trace(T), t(T) := (n1,..,nZ)`
* `(#t == #N)` is true

Since `t` is an ordered sequence over the nodes `N` of a tree, any child can
be understood to have a unique index associated with it - its index in the
tree's trace of nodes. Based on that, any parent can be understood to have a
first and a last child, and therefore to have a child order associated with it.

**The child order of a parent CO(p)** can be defined as an induced subsequence
(i.e. a total suborder) to the tree's trace of nodes, induced by the parent's
set of child nodes. As such, the child order of a parent can be described as
"an ordered sequence of child nodes", or as **an ordered sequence of siblings**.

* `CO(p) := t[c(p)] := (c1,..,cZ)`

Note that `CO(p)` is not required to be a substring of `t(T)`, which is
consistent with the removal-based mathematical definition of "sub-sequence".

**The child order of a tree CO(T)** can be defined as a simple set of non-empty
child orders, one for each parent node. Put differently, and since each total
order corresponds with an ordered sequence, the child order of a tree is a set
of ordered sequences of siblings.

* `CO(T) := { t[c(p)] | (p in PN) }`

Note that the child order of a parent is disjoint to the child order of another
parent. As such, the child order of a tree can be described as a forest of
pairwise disjoint child orders.

Note that, if a child order is associated with a tree, then a child order is
associated with all of its parent nodes. That is, there is no tree such that
some parents have a child order, while others do not. Put differently, either
each parent has a child order associated with it, ex-or none at all.

## the cover relation of a child order

Since the child order of a parent node can be described as an induced ordered
sequence of siblings, a parent can be understood to be associated with an order
relation that formalizes its child order. That is, for a parent node `p` and
its ordered sequence of child nodes `CO(p) := (c1,..,c2)` one can define the
cover relation `R(p)` of its order relation as follows:

* `R(p) := CO(V,E)` where `V := c(p)` and ..
* `E := { (a,b) | (a next-presequent-to b) }`
* `(a next-presequent-to b) := (idx(a) == idx(b)-1)`
* note - `idx()` is in regards to `CO(p)`

Note that `R(p)` is a cover relation since its set of edges is not transitive.
Despite that, and as a matter of convenience, subsequent discussions will treat
such a cover relation as being synonymous to the underlying transitive order
relation. That is, the focus will be on transitively reduced sets of edges.

As a matter of consequence, the child order `R(T)` of a tree `T(N,E)` can be
defined as the cover relation of an actual order relation:

* `R(T) := CO(V,E)` where `V := CN(T)` and ..
* `E := { e | (e in R(p)) for (p in PN) }`

That is, a tree which has a child order associated with it can be described
as being accompanied by a cover relation such that it contains an edge for
each pair of adjacent siblings.

Note that it is these edges that must be embedded into the tree order of a
document tree.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## first/last/next/previous sibling

Given the order relation `R(p)` of a parent's child order,
the following definitions can be made:

* `(c first-child-of p)` := `c` has no sibling `s` such that `sRc`
* `(c last-child-of p)` := `c` has no sibling `s` such that `cRs`
* `(s next-sibling-of c) := cRs` and `(s previous-sibling-of c) := sRc`

Assuming an indicator function `aPb` such that it is true if a path can be
formed over the edges in `R(p)` (i.e. if an edge exists in the underlying
order relation), the following definitions can be made:

* `(a presquent-sibling-of b) := aPb`
* `(a subsequent-sibling-of b) := bPa`

Note that the **next sibling** `s` of a child `c` is such that there is no
other sibling `t` subsequent-to `c` and also presequent-to `s`. That is,
based on the child order, there is no other sibling in between `c` and `s`.
Because of that, `s` can also be described as the **next-subsequent** sibling.

Note that the **previous sibling** `s` of a child `c` is such that ther is
no other sibling `t` presequent-to `c` and also subsequent-to `s`. That is,
based on the child order, there is no other sibling in between `s` and `c`.
Because of that, `s` can also be described as the **next-presequent** sbiling.

## semantical considerations - to be ignored

```
child order CO(p)      cover graph
=================  =>  ====================
(c1,c2,c3,c4)          c1 -> c2 -> c3 -> c4
```

Since the order relation of a child order `CO(p)` can be said to have the
**presequent-sibling-of** semantics associated with it, and since the order
relation of a tree `T(N,E)` can be said to have the **ancestor-of** semantics,
one first needs to resolve the issue with seemingly incompatible semantics.

However, since the child order of a parent can be understood to be defined
in terms of an ordered sequence of siblings, one can transform the child
order of a parent into **a path graph**. Consequently, and since each path
graph is also **a node tree**, the **ancestor-of** semantics can be said
to also apply to the child order of a parent.

* `(ci presequent-sibling-of cj) <=> (ci ancestor-of cj)`

Furthermore, and since the terms "sibling" and "ancestor" are such that one
in general associates a particular meaning with them, and based on that also
certain expectations, one should recall that the generic edge-based semantics
still apply. That is, the "ancestor-of" semantics is still synonymous to the
**presequent-to** semantics. To be more clear, "presequent-sibling-of" and
"ancestor-of" can both be said to be defined based on the sequence-based
"presequent-to" semantics.

* `(ci presequent-sibling-of cj) := (ci presequent-to cj)`
* `(ci ancestor-of cj) := (ci presequent-to cj)`

Because of that, one should **ignore these semantical considerations** since
they do not define the relationships between the nodes. After all, they are
only used to describe the relationships using terms that are specific to a
given context.
