- embedding a child order

if you know that you have a transitive closure
- then you know that (a) in (a,x) is a ce
- the union of all the endpoints of all the edges formes the scope of (a)
- a way to efficiently calculate the transitive reduction?
- howto determine if a sink is a child and not some other descendant?
