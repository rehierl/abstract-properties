# doctree order
- the document order is the pre-order trace of a doctree
- embedded into it is a partial containment order
- both of which are encoded using the tag-based syntax

consequences which result from that
- (1) a tag soup ain't no node tree
- (2) well-formedness is a must, DI-RE
- (3) associate while visiting/entering
