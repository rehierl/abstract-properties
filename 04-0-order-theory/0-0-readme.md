in contraty to graph theory, order theory seems to focus on vertices
- the edges are a consequence of the order operator
- an edge exists for each pair of vertices
  for which the order operator returns true
- the order operator determines its results
  based upon vertex properties/characteristics
- there is no degree of freedom in which edges to add

Note that the properties of an ordered set are determined based on the
properties of the underlying order relation - e.g. reflexive, transitive,
anti-symmetric, connex, ...
