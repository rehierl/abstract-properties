# order theory
- a recap on order theory
- apart from a throgrough basic understanding,
  no in-depth knowledge of order theory is required
- the focus is on suborders of posets and tosets

partial orders
- cover vertices with more than one incoming edge (?)
- if yes - will have to clarify - a tree corresponds
  with a partial order - since posets can then be
  said to cover more possibilities
- if yes, then prefixes and infixes may be disjoint
  to and even overlap each other
- if no, then prefixes may "only" be disjoint
