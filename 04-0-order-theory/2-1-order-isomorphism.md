# order isomorphism

An order isomorphism is a bijective function `(f: P -> Q)` that maps one order
`P := (V,<)` onto another order `Q := (W,<)` such that the process can be
reversed. That is, an inverse process `f°` can be defined such that.

* `(f°(f(P)) == P)`

Note that two orders `P` and `Q`, for which there is such a bijective mapping,
can be described as being **order isomorphic** to each other.

Note that an order isomorphism `f` must be order-preserving since otherwise no
inverse `f°` could exist. That is, both orders are of the same **order type**.

Based on the above, two order isomorphic orders will be (loosely) described
to **correspond with each other**, which is merely intended to underline that
one can be transformed into the other.
