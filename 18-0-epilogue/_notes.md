# which conclusions to summarize ..

a tree order is ..
- a downward-total partial order
- a specialized partial order

an ancestor is not subsequent to a descendant
- a div container does not belong to the section of a descendant
- by itself, even that seems to suggest that the section of a
  heading must by default end with the heading's parent container
- not now, not ever (!)
