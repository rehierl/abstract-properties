- this is about the concept of generic properties
  and as such a purely theoretical discussion
- possible proof-of-concept (poc) implementations

a tag soup ain't no (fucking) node tree
- could use a proof-of-concept implementation
  in regards to tag soups
- used to point out the implicit theoretical steps
  that can be skipped based upon the structure of the
  doctree's pre-order trace

a length-based encoding/decoding
- based on the fact that there are multiple ways to
  derive a partial order from a node tree - each of
  which corresponds with with the source node tree
- based on the structure of a doctree's pre-order trace
