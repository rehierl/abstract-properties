- total orders from generic properties

ordered sequence
-> family of scopes
-> total order

family of scopes
-> path graph
-> family of scopes

remarks
- nodes/vertices within the scope of multiple properties
- properties of similar "kind"
- the relationships between the scopes of these properties
  establish a total hierarchy of scopes
- a path graph can be derived from an "ordered sequence"
- which explains why a sequence can be visualized as a path
- the sequence can be recreated the same way

intervals
- "hierarchy of nested intervals/sets" - somehow redundant
  not quite - if "nested" applies to all, then total
  hierarchy of (possibly nested) intervals, then partial
  must be the default

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

remark
- it appears to be quite difficult to point out
  the issue with something that doesn't seem to make sense
- after all, if it could be clearly described,
  it wouldn't be much of an issue ..

( a subtle side aspect )
Note that each interval can be understood to correspond with an ordered subset
of elements. Because of that, any scope can be understood to correspond with
an ordered (sub)set of nodes. - even though a scope is no family of sets.
