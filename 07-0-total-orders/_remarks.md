# total orders derived from abstract properties

ordered sequence
-> family of scopes
-> total order

family of scopes
-> path graph
-> family of scopes

nodes within the scope of multiple properties
- properties of similar "kind"
- the relationships between the scopes of these properties
  establish a total hierarchy of scopes
- a path graph can be derived from an "ordered sequence"
- which explains why a sequence can be visualized as a path
- the sequence can be recreated the same way

Recall that an ordered sequence can be described as a sequence of distinct
elements that is paired with a total order over its elements. The total order
over its elements can be understood to be defined based upon the index order
of the ordered sequence.

Recall that any interval can be understood to define an **induced suborder**.
Consequently, the same applies to any scope. The scope of an abstract property
can be understood to correspond with an induced suborder.

# extra

some-of as a composed quantifier
- some-of := all-of, but none-of
- an interval-based point of view
- some-of := (a,*) \ (b,*)

"hierarchy of nested intervals/sets"
- somehow redundant - not quite
- if "nested" applies to all, then total
  hierarchy of (possibly nested) intervals,
  then partial must be the default

# meta

turing machines
- the idea of a turing machine pops up on a regular basis
- the core concept of a multi-tape/track machine
- section properties written to additional tapes
- this "image" can be used to "visualize" the relationships
  between multiple/shared sections/properties

remark
- it appears to be quite difficult to point out
  the issue with something that doesn't seem to make sense
- after all, if it could be clearly described,
  it wouldn't be much of an issue ..
