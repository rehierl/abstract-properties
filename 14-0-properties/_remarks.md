- the document order is the doctree's pre-order trace
- derived from that - types of properties/scopes

the some-but-not-all qualifier
- when types of scopes have been defined
- an end-tag separates a node's type-1 (t1) descendants
  from its remaining t2 descendants - i.e. from the
  subsequent siblings and their t1 descendants
- or - from the next subsequent sibling and its t2 descendants
- as such, an end-tag provides a clear definition
  for the some-but-not-all case/qualifier
- a partition of its type-2 descendants
