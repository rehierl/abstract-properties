# overall remarks

Recall that the extended set of nodes in `D*(n)` can be described as the open
interval `[n,*]` over the unordered document tree (DTU). Because of that, the
number of nodes in these sets is equal to the length of the pre-order trace
`pre(n)` of the corresponding node. Hence, the description as a "length-based"
rather than a "size-based" encoding.
