a level-order encoding (lvl-co)
- based on the level-order tree traversal
- must use group-ids in order to denote a child order

note that ..
- all child orders are substrings to the level-order trace
- compression - e.g. a sequence of (count,parent) intervals
- two numbers per non-empty child order
