# implicit encodings

- no explicit edge definitions
- e.g. in terms of level values or scope sizes

sequences can be used to define trees (?)
- nested intervals - (f: Index -> Length)
- (a,b) = the pre-order trace of (a) has length (b)
- i.e. stretches over the next (b) nodes
- i.e. a length-based encoding

sequences can be used to define trees (?)
- node level/depth - (f: Index -> Level)
- (a,b) = node (a) is at node level (b)
- i.e. a level-based encoding
