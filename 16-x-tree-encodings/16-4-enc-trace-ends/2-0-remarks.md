# overall remarks

Note that the end-based implicit encoding scheme is a minor modification to the
length-based encoding scheme. The core improvement is however only in regards
to the computational complexity of the encoding algorithms.

Note that this encoding scheme might be of use in the context of an actual
application. Theoretical discussions will however focus on the length-based
encoding scheme since length values seem more comprehensible than seemingly
arbitrary index values.
