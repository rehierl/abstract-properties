- build upon the introduction of generic properties
  in the context of ordered sequences (total orders)
- point out the concept of generic properties
  in the context of node trees (partial orders)

order theory
- provide order-based definitions for
  well-known path-based definitions

some-of as a composed quantifier
- relevant beginning with partial orders
- some-of := all-of, but none-of
- an interval-based point of view
- some-of := (a,*) \ (b,*)

extended
- intervalls require an underlying order
- induced subtrees can be described as intervalls
- here, intervalls over partial rather than total orders
- the scope of a property can still be described
  as an interval over the underlying node order
