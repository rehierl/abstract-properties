- build upon the introduction of abstract properties
  in the context of ordered sequences (total orders)
- point out the concept of abstract properties
  in the context of node trees (partial orders)

order theory
- provide order-based definitions for
  well-known path-based definitions

some-of as a composed quantifier
- relevant beginning with partial orders
- some-of := all-of, but none-of
- an interval-based point of view
- some-of := (a,*) \ (b,*)
