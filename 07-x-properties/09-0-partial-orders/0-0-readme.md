# partial orders
- isomorphic partial orders

As before, this chapter describes transformations that transform one construct
`ci` into another construct `cj` such that the formed construct `cj` can be
reversed back into `ci`. These isomorphisms can be visualized as follows.

```
T <-> Q <-> P <-> S
|<--------->|
```

* `T` - node trees
* `Q` - partial orders of nodes
* `P` - partial orders of scopes
* `S` - (partial) families of scopes
