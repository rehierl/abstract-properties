# set theory (ST)
- an introduction to set theory

Note that this chapter is similar to the chapter on Category theory (CT).
It mainly as a pointer to a particular area of Mathematics (i.e. ST),
which is overall a higher level of abstraction and as such fundamental
to the overall discussion.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## (naive) set theory (NST)

Thus far, it should be obvious that Mathematics is a lot more than just about
numbers or functions. After all, in all previous chapters there have hardly
been any calculations, if any at all. Instead, the focus of those chapters
was on sets of elements, and the relationships between these sets, defined and
visualized in terms of graphs and orders. Because of that, most definitions
used in naive set theory have already been introduced and used throughout
previous chapters.

That is, sets of elements have been defined informally using natural language,
or in terms of the set-builder notation. Also, operations on sets have been
defined using more or less informal means, most of us should have already been
familiar with from basic introductions to Mathematics.

* set-builder notaiton: `S := { x | x has property P }`
* element membership (i.e. contains)
* equal, unequal, distinct
* (proper) superset-/subset-of
* union, intersection, disjoint
* set difference, symmetric difference
* power set

Despite the above, the focus of previous chapters was not on concrete sets of
elements, but rather on their use as abstract containers and to define complex
constructs such as endo-relations.

## (axiomatic) set theory (AST)

AST takes NST to the next level of abstraction. That is because AST is mostly
concerned with objects that are relevant to mathematics as a whole. As such,
AST is, similar to CT, used as a foundational system of mathematics.

Note that trees in AST are seen as partial orders that have a specific
requirements (e.g. well-ordered) associated with them.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## (descriptive) set theory (DST)

One focus of DST is on certain classes of "well-behaved" subsets of real
numbers. Based on that, DST is a main area of research in ST.

Note that trees in DST are seen as collections of sequences such that every
prefix of a sequence in it also belongs to the collection. Consequently, and
as before, even in DST trees are seen as partially ordered sets that have
certain requirements associated with them (e.g. a set of all rooted paths).

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## remark

Note that, as mentioned above, the analogous counter parts of node trees in
AST and in DST are both based on partial orders and as such constructs of
Order Theory.
