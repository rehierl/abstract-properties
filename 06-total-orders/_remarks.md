ordered sequence
-> family of scopes
-> total order

family of scopes
-> path graph
-> family of scopes

remarks
- nodes/vertices within the scope of multiple properties
- properties of similar "kind"
- the relationships between the scopes of these properties
  establish a total hierarchy
- a path graph can be derived from an "ordered sequence"
- which explains why a sequence can be visualized as a path
- the sequence can be recreated the same way
- an ordered sequence is a sequence paired with a total order

extended
- intervalls require an underlying order
- introduce the intervall-based perspective

remark
- each ordered set is defined based upon one order operator only
- i.e. `<` ex-or `<=`

remark
- it appears to be quite difficult to point out
  the issue with something that doesn't seem to make sense
- after all, if it could be clearly described,
  it wouldn't be much of an issue ..
