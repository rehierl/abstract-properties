ordered sequence
-> family of scopes
-> total order

family of scopes
-> path graph
-> family of scopes

remarks
- define "ordered sequence"
- nodes/vertices within the scope of multiple properties
- properties of similar "kind"
- the relationships between the scopes of these properties
  establish a total hierarchy
- a path graph can be derived from an "ordered sequence"
- which explains why a sequence can be visualized as a path
- the sequence can be recreated the same way

extended
- intervalls require an underlying order
- introduce the intervall-based perspective

non-ordered sequences
- visualize the issue with repeated occurrences in non-ordered sequences
- note - there seems to be a difference between `(.., a, a, ..)` and
  `(.., a, b, a, ..)` since cases of the former pattern could be ignored
- i.e. presequent and subsequent to itself - and what about `b`? -
  after all, it is subsequent and also presequent to `a`
- note - each ordered set is defined based upon one order operator only
- i.e. `<` ex-or `<=`

remark
- it appears to be quite difficult to point out
  the issue with something that doesn't appear to make sense
- after all, if it could be clearly described,
  it wouldn't be much of an issue ..
