remarks
- "pre-order" in this context is not to be confused with
  the mathematical concept of "preorder" order relations
- "pre-order" is in regards to the pre-order tree traversal,
  i.e. in regards to its pre-order trace of nodes

remarks
- add the pre-order edges to the tree order of the ordered tree
- this will result in the pre-order trace of nodes
- referred to as a (linear) extension of the tree order
- the document order is the doctree's pre-order trace of nodes

remarks
- explain the inner structure of the pre-order trace
- explain the enter/exit order
- each node corresponds with its start-tag, nothing else
- visiting a node corresponds with processing its start-tag only
- an end-tag marks the end of a scope, nothing more
