- a quick recap on order theory
- detailed discussions are not necessary
- an in-depth knowledge is not required
- some keywords are - e.g. transitive

a generalized perspective on intervals
- point out that an interval defines
  a subset of elements
- a subset that can be used to induce
  a suborder
- i.e. an interval can be understood
  to define an induced suborder
- i.e. intervals can be used to efficiently
  describe suborders

TODO
- don't forget about - maths / notes,
  this is a long-term aspect
