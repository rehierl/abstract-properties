a generalized perspective on intervals
- point out that an interval defines
  a subset of elements
- a subset that can be used to induce
  a suborder
- i.e. an interval can be understood
  to define an induced suborder
- i.e. intervals can be used to efficiently
  describe suborders

intervals (2)
- any interval requires an known set of elements
- with that set, a known order must be associated, since
  otherwise one would not know what is in between both
  of the endpoints and therefore not which elements to
  include in the set an interval defines/describes
- similar to intervals based upon total orders/numbers,
  intervals can be defined based upon partial orders
- i.e. based upon the order's order operator
- what about sub-intervals of equal/incomparable elements?

generalization
- each interval specifies a subset of elements
- based upon an ordered set of elements
- each interval specifies an ordered subset

intervals (3)
- "hierarchy of nested intervals/sets" - somehow redundant
  not quite - if "nested" applies to all, then total
  hierarchy of (possibly nested) intervals, then partial
  must be the default
