next main aspects
- show examples for order embeddings
- so the introduction of types of scopes becomes obvious
- that will then transition to properties of different types

the overall aspect
- shared properties establish a hierarchy
- not so much about properties
- more about scopes

after that use further hierarchies to
- introduce rank values - as node levels

peer - an object at the same level
- not the same as "sibling" (!)
- peers may/could have different parents
- use "sequence of peers" rather than "sequence of siblings"?
- feels closer to items that are "loosely related"
- sounds/feels odd ..

# the general transition

first flat documents
- the focus was on flat documents - total orders
- into which we did embed a hierarchy of sections
- why did/does that seem to work seemlessly ?!?

then hierarchies
- the focus is now on partial suborders
- all properties seem to be restricted to induced subtrees
- as if we did forget about the unrestricted case
- almost - see headings
