- provide visual examples for order embeddings

dom tree - order embedding
- point out the implementation-specific
  aspects of a dom tree
- explain why the tree orders can still be said
  to be sub-orders to that non-tree graph

general impression
- we are overly used to total orders
- we are barely aware of partial orders

could use detailed explanations with visual examples
- i.e. how node orders are embedded into other node orders
- e.g. a sub-order, but no sub-graph

total orders embedded into partial orders
- e.g. child orders, rooted paths

partial orders embedded into total orders
- e.g. a tree in a pre-order trace
- not embedded as a subtree

partial orders embedded into partial orders
- e.g. connected via an incoming border edge
- e.g. an unordered tree in its ordered tree
- the partial order relation is not embedded as a subtree
- e.g. the section hierarchy?
- defined by, but not embedded as a suborder
