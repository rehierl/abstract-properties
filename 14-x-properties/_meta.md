overall
- trees are an application of order theory
- the concept of abstract properties is an application of order theory
- a hierarchy of scopes is an application of abstract properties
- a tag soup defines a hierarchy of scopes, the partial containment order

continuous discussions
- may in general have the effect of maintaining/enforcing confusion
- since we willingly or unwillingly tend to listen
- sometimes silence and determination are the better choice

evolution
- looking into the sky with no telescopes
- one could initially assume that earth is in the center
- the longer it took to develop the tools to proof that
  initial assumption wrong, the more time that point of
  view had to become doctrine
- the more tifficult it became to overcome it

devolution
- seeing elements as complex units is oversimplification
- unjustified by what we already knew about node trees
- each element is translated into a node
- this simplification mislead people to believe that
  one could associate an element while exiting it
- due to the h1-div-h1 issue it should have been clear
  that this could never work out
- the longer this oversimplification is praised in the
  context of anti-purity, the more it became a doctrine
- it is this ignorance that kept us from truly progressing
- similar to the dwarfism of animal species
