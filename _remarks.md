generic properties
- "generic" in order to distinguish these properties
  from those of a graph
- i.e. properties/characteristics inherent to particular graph/tree

note to self
- be clear
- stay on topic
- keep it slim

as an intermediate goal
- flesh it out only up until types of properties are defined

# remarks

- document order - the pre-order trace
- tree order - the node order of the document tree
- keep the difference of - total vs. partial
