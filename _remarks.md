the readme files
- all are more or less "initialized"
- i.e. they need to be fleshed out at some point

the overall intention is to communicate ..
- a certain style of notation
- my current level of understanding
- my non-standard definitions
- the conclusions i derive from my understanding
- the overall aspects involved
- all of that - to enable others to proof me wrong

coin "structurally dependent"
- then "structurally independent"
- then an order relation based on that ?!?
- in regards to (div) containers

computer languages ?!?
- using the for-each loop, randomize the iteration
  over node trees that have no child order
- would require node tree types that are
  integrated into a programming language
- can be circumvented by custom tree types
- randomization adds computational complexity
- so debug mode only - removed in release
- will push programmers to pay more attention
  to which and if a tree has a child order
- i.e. be more aware of that aspect
- i.e. be more aware of what the true node order is
