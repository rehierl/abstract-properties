- it won't work without repeating content

note to self
- be clear - stay on topic
- keep it (somewhat) simple/slim

note to others
- be lenient in regards to explanations/analogies
- be strict in regards to substantial/fundamental aspects

the overall intention is to communicate ..
- a certain style of notation
- my current level of understanding
- my non-standard definitions
- the conclusions i derive from my understanding
- the overall aspects involved
- all of that - to enable others to proof me wrong

# todos
