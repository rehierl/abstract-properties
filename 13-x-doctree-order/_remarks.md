# doctree order

The **above-of** order is no level-order since the tag-based notation of the
above-of order does not support this kind of node order. The above-of order
is as a sequence of interleaved child orders. Also, a level-order trace does
not contain hierarchical groups of consecutive nodes since such a trace is a
sequence of disjoint child orders.

Note that the **pre-order traversal** of a tree will enter the nodes in
document-order. Because of that, the document-order may also be referred
to as the visit-order (formerly enter-order).
