# document traversal / (default) post-order (PostD)

This chapter provides a brief discussion of the (default) post-order rule.

* the (default) post-order rule := `(c × n × s)`
* `trace(n) := trace(fc) × ... × trace(lc) × n`

Note that the resulting total node order is overall not order-preserving.

* it does not preserve the tree order
* it preserves the child order
