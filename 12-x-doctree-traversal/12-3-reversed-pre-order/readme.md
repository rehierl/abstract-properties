This chapter provides a brief discussion of the reversed pre-order rule.

* the reversed pre-order rule := `(n × cR × sR)`
* `trace(n) := n × trace(lc) × ... × trace(fc)`

Note that the resulting total node order is overall not order-preserving.

* preserves the tree order
* does not preserve the child order
