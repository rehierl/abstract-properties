This chapter provides a brief discussion of the reversed post-order rule.

* the reversed post-order rule := `(cR × n × sR)`
* `trace(n) := trace(lc) × ... × trace(fc) × n`

Note that the resulting total node order is not order-preserving.

* does not preserve the tree order
* does not preserve the child order
