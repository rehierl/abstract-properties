## remarks

Many thanks to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) for covering
[Order Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory).
Without that coverage, this repository would most likely not exist.

It is recommended to download the repository and to read the markup files
in it using a multi-tab text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/),
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or some other
IDE such as [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).

Most chapters can be described as meta chapters, which group several chapters.
These grouped subchapters cover a certain aspect, introduce a new one, or
extend a previous meta chapter. Subchapters are not subdivided into further
subchapters, which is why the folder structure structure is overall shallow.
Despite the shallow folder structure, this repository is rather extensive:
There are more than 59 folders and 387 markup files.

Note that each chapter should contain a readme file in order to provide an
overview of the contents it holds.

## meta

Note that I am aware that this content is far from paper-grade quality. One
therefore needs to keep in mind that my focus is on consistency and overall
common aspects, not on visuals or non-substantial aspects such as typos.

Note that it is difficult to explain ideas that are new to some extent since
one must use words that already have a meaning. Because of that, it won't work
without inaccuracies, or even without having to cause confusion. Readers are
therefore advised to not try to read between the lines, but instead to try to
recognize the common patterns amongst the noise.

Note that one will certainly find repetitions (i.e. noise, e.g. a multitude
of hierarchies) which are provided in an attempt to explain the same "thing"
from a different angle. The intent of this is an attempt to highlight the
underlying structure (i.e. the common patterns). All of that can be understood
to peak in the length-based (scopes) and the level-based (context) encodings
of a tree, both of which can be understood as being dual to each other.
