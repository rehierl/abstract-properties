## remarks

Many thanks to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) for covering
[Order Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory).
Without that knowledge, this repository would most likely not exist.

Note that it is recommended to download the repository and to read the
markup files in a multi-tab text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/),
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or some other IDE
such as [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).

Note that it is difficult to explain ideas that are new to some extent since
one must use words that already have a meaning. Because of that, it won't
work without inaccuracies, or even without having to cause confusion. Readers
are therefore advised to not try to read between the lines, but instead to
try to recognize the common patterns amongst the noise.

Note that I am aware that this content is far from paper-grade quality. One
therefore needs to keep in mind that my focus is on consistency and overall
common aspects, not so much on non-substantial issues such as typos.
