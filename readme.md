It is recommended to download the repository and to read the source code in a
multi-tab text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
[Atom](https://atom.io/), or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).

I am well aware that the content of this repository is far from paper-grade
quality. When reading one therefore needs to keep in mind that my focus is
on consistency and overall common aspects, not so much on minor issues such
as typos. With that in mind, GitHub issues on fundamental inconsistencies
are welcome.
