# overall notes

It is recommended to download the repository and to read the source code in a
multi-tab text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
[Atom](https://atom.io/), or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).

Note that it is difficult to explain ideas that are new to some extent since
one must use words that already have a meaning. Because of that, it won't work
without inaccuracies, or even confusion. Readers are therefore advised to not
read between the lines, but to try to recognize patterns amongst the noise.

I am aware that this content is far from paper-grade quality. When reading one
therefore needs to keep in mind that my focus is on consistency and overall
common aspects, not so much on minor issues such as typos.
