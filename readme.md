- about the evolution of our ability to write
- generic properties, a bottom up approach
- an interval- and/or order-based point of view
- ordered trees are fictional, they do not exist
- a tag soup ain't no (fucking) node tree
- no more than 4 types of properties are possible
- about our ability to use partial order to our advantage
- about the evolution of the human race/civilization,
  the responsibility of experts, the responsibility
  of the scientific community
- you do not fuck that up - however, it did happen
- ... so yeah ... this is going to be big ...

a looong and painful experience
- based on what i have learned from analyzing the w3c's outline algorithm,
  which sums up to learning about its several core issues and therefore
  learning about what not to do
- based on what i have learned from trying to develop my own design,
  which sums up to refreshing my memory of basic mathematics, and drowning
  in all the aspects that might or might not be involved
- based on what i have learned from trying to summarize the core aspects
  of what i have learned thus far, which sums up to realizing certain key
  aspects
- based on what i have learned whil wasting a lot of time trying to accept
  just how hard we have manage to needlessly fuck it up, which sums up to
  slightly increasing the clarity of certain aspects one step at a time.
- based on all of that ...

another attempt to sum it up ...
- the base concept of properties/scope/context
- order theory as its foundation, graph theory as
  a consequence, category theory to bind it together
- derive core node orders by adding sets of edges
- these orders are the basis to define types of scopes
- these scopes are the basis of a type system of properties
- only 4 types of properties can be defined
- only 3 make sense in the context of a tag-based syntax
