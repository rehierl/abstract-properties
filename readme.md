## overall notes

It is recommended to download the repository and to read the markup files in a
multi-tab text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
[Atom](https://atom.io/), or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).

Note that it is difficult to explain ideas that are new to some extent since
one must use words that already have a meaning. Because of that, it won't work
without inaccuracies, or even without having to cause confusion. Readers are
therefore advised to not read between the lines, but to try to recognize
patterns amongst the noise.

I am aware that this content is far from paper-grade quality. One should
therefore keep in mind that my focus is on consistency and overall common
aspects, not so much on minor issues such as typos.
