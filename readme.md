- key aspects of what is to follow

alternative titles
- generic properties, a bottom up approach
- an interval- and/or order-based point of view
- an ordered tree is just another un-ordered tree
- ordered trees are fictional, they do not exist
- a tag soup ain't no (fucking) node tree
- no more than 4 types of properties are possible
- the hx-div-hy issue, an inconsistentcy of scopes

science
- some say science is to see what others see, and to think of something new
- the issue here is however not with "something new", since the knowledge
  required in order to develop a consistent alternative is already known
- this ain't quantum physics, and it ain't rocket science
- this is about simple sets of elements (aka. scopes)
- hence, the following statement seems to be more appropriate:
- science is to see what others see, and to accept it for what it is

a painful experience
- based on what i have learned from analyzing the w3c's outline algorithm,
  which resulted in having to learn about its several issues and therefore
  learning about what not to do.
- based on what i have learned from trying to develop my own design, which
  resulted in refreshing my memory of what i was taught about mathematics,
  and drowning in all the aspects that might or might not be involved.
- based on what i have learned from trying to summarize the relevant
  aspects, which resulted in realizing fundamental key aspects.
- based on what i have learned while trying to accept just how hard
  we have managed to fuck it up, which resulted in increasing my
  understanding of key aspects one tiny step at a time.

based on all of that ...
- here is yet another attempt to sum it all up ...
- the base concept of properties/scope/context
- order theory as its foundation, graph theory as a
  consequence, category theory to bind it all together
- define node orders by adding sets of edges, one set at a time
- the resulting node orders allow to define types of scopes,
  which in turn allow to define types of properties
- only 4 types of properties are possible
- only 3 types make sense in the context of a tag-based syntax
- the bit issue therefore is with inconsistent scopes

this is as serious as it can get
- this is an issue of significant importance
- the tag-based syntax is an application of a system of properties
- so no, this isn't just about html/xml/..
- this is about the evolution of our ability to write, an
  ability that is critical to the evolution of the human race
- so no, this does not just concern those with disabilities,
  this concerns every single human being with or without
  disabilities, including all the future generations
- this is about our ability to use partial orders to our advantage
- this is about our general awareness of node orders
- this is about the responsibility of experts, and because of that ..
- this is about the responsibility of the scientific community
- so yes, this is about the evolution of the human race,
  in more ways than most are aware of
