## remarks

Many thanks to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) for covering
[Order Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory).
Without that coverage, this repository would most likely not exist.

It is recommended to download the repository and to read the markup files
using a multi-tab text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/),
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or some other
IDE such as [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).

Most chapters can be described as meta chapters, which group several chapters.
Such groups cover a certain aspect, introduce a new one, or extend a previous
meta chapter. Subchapters are not further subdivided into subchapters, which
is why the folder structure structure is overall shallow. Despite that, this
repository is rather extensive since it holds around 460 items (files and
folders).

Note that each folder should contain a readme file in order to provide an
overview of its contents.

## meta

Note that I am aware that this content is far from paper-grade quality. One
therefore needs to keep in mind that my focus is on consistency and overall
common aspects, not on visuals or non-substantial aspects such as typos.

Note that it is difficult to explain ideas that are new to some extent since
one must use words that already have a meaning. Because of that, it won't work
without inaccuracies, or even without having to cause confusion. Readers are
therefore advised to not try to read between the lines, but instead to try to
recognize the common patterns amongst the noise.

Note that one will certainly find repetitions (i.e. noise, e.g. a multitude
of isomorphismen) which are provided in an attempt to explain the same "thing"
from different angles. The intent of this is an attempt to highlight the
underlying structure (i.e. the common patterns). All of that can be understood
to peak in the length-based (scopes) and the level-based (context) encoding
of a tree, both of which can be understood as dual to each other.
