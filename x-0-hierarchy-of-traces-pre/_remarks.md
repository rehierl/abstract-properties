- Hpre - a hierarchy of pre-order traces

# family of traces
- obviously not any traces
- a family of pre-order traces
- possibly also - family of post-order traces
- after all, there is some duality
- aka. family of strings

finalize with "a family of strings" ?
- just to proof the obvious - it adds up
- efficiency the ce() as the first item
- a tag soup ain't no (fucking) node tree

this isn't just to round it up
- the basis to proof that a tree can be encoded
- as a sequence of length values
- as a sequence of level values
