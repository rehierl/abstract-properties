# abstract properties

This meta chapter introduces the core concept of abstract properties as
characteristics of some kind whose **scopes** can be described as open
intervals over the corresponding node order.

Note that the concept of abstract properties generalizes the concept of
sections, which is why it is based on certain strict principles such as
**the past-present-future principle**. Based on that, the concept of
abstract properties follows the **stream-based perspective**.

Note that this concept does open a door to clear definitions of the difficult
to define **some-of** quantifier. That is because the some-of quantifier can
be restricted such that it can be expressed as a combination of the easy to
define all-of and none-of quantifiers.

```
(s <-> S), (T <-> S)
```

In order to show that this concept can be used for explanations, this meta
chapter uses the underlying concept of scopes in order to introduce two core
**isomorphisms**: (1) Any ordered sequence `s` is isomorphic to a (total)
family of scopes `S`, and (2) any node tree `T` is isomorphic to a (partial)
family of scopes `S`.
