- a quick recap on basic mathematical definitions
- e.g. groups/multisets, (simple) sets, sequences
- the focus is on those mathematical concepts that
  are essential to the overall discussion
- the following is also intended to establish and
  to communicate a certain style of notation
- note - standard and non-standard definitions

remark
- an operation to turn any sequence to an ordered sequence:
  keep first occurences, remove any subsequent repetitions
- based on the "order" in the source sequence
- which has precedence? the first occurrence, the last?

remark
- note the inherent similarties between operators defined
  based upon sets and sequences - i.e. subset-of, substring-of

remark
- tuples / Kuratowski's definition
- somewhat similar in thought?
