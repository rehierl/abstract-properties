- a quick recap on basic mathematical definitions
- e.g. groups/multisets, (simple) sets, sequences
- the focus is on those mathematical concepts
  that are essential to the overall discussion

point out the similarties between the operators
- defined based upon sets and sequences
- i.e. subset-of, substring-of
