- a quick recap on basic mathematical definitions
- e.g. groups/multisets, (simple) sets, sequences
- the focus is on those mathematical concepts
  that are essential to the overall discussion
- the following is also intended to establish
  and to communicate a certain style of notation
- note - standard and non-standard definitions

remarks
- note the inherent similarties between the operators defined
  based upon sets and sequences - i.e. subset-of, substring-of

remarks
- tuples / Kuratowski's definition
- somewhat similar in thought?
