- to show the use of suborders
- to show the use of types of scopes
- i.e. a type-N removal

removal of a node
- one of the most basic operations is the removal of a node
- seen as the removal of an entire induced subtree
- the removal of a suffix/intervall in regards to its order
- i.e. what effects does the operation on a tree
  have on the tree's underlying partial order?

comparison of removal-based operations
- this has to do with order embedding
- i.e. to show the differences
- use to transition to types of scopes?
- removal of a node in a tree
- removal of an item from an ordered set
- a tree falls apart - an order remains intact

even more ways to look at it
- remove a node and all of its descendants
- vs. remove + maintain the remaining order

node trees / operations
- the definition of operation as an application of generic properties
- i.e. in regards to defining the scope of an operation
- builds upon types of scopes - i.e. "scope x of node y"
- remove = always the removal of an entire suffix/intervall
  in regards to the appropriate node order

point out the difference in default cases
- in regards to the removal of an item
- total/sequences - defaults to type-0 scopes
- partial/trees - defaults to type-1 scopes
- we do treat sequences and trees differently
