# setups of sets (2)

point out that ..
- a partial order is more than what meets the eye
- thus far aligned to one case - superset + di-xor-re

setup-t3-partial
- since each tree must have one and only one root
- rps are either related ex-or overlap each other
- i.e. they are never disjoint

superset-of
- issue with multiple sources
- more than one ce

subset-of
- issue with multipe sinks?
- more than once ce?

## the transitive reduction of a poset

```
v1 -> v2
v3
```

* may have disconnected vertices

```
     |-> v2 ->|
v1 ->|        |-> v4
     |-> v3 ->|
```

* may have incomparable vertices
* any vertex may have any number of incoming edges
* any vertex may have any number of outgoing edges

```
v1 ->|-> v3
v2 ->|
```

* may have any number of source vertices

```
v1 ->|-> v3
     |-> v4
```

* may have any number of leaf vertices
