remarks
- "pre-order" in this context is not to be confused with
  the mathematical concept of "preorder" order relations
- "pre-order" is in regards to the pre-order tree traversal,
  i.e. in regards to its pre-order trace of nodes

remarks
- add the pre-order edges to the tree order of the ordered tree
- this will result in the pre-order trace of nodes
- referred to as a (linear) extension of the tree order
- explain the inner structure of the pre-order trace

remarks
- do not use this in regards to the tag-based syntax (!)
- this must be done in ... 10-epilog-issues
