- a topological ordering?

point out the confusing situation
- by default names remain in regards to the unordered tree
- if in doubt use patterns - e.g. "a node's former subsequent sibling"

sequence of siblings
- the goal find a more generic term for a sequence
  of things that have some characteristic in common
- e.g. a sequence of peers - "peer" is less common but still already in use

if you know that you have a transitive closure
- then you know that (a) in (a,x) is a ce
- the union of all the endpoints of all the edges formes the scope of (a)
- a way to effectively calculate the transitive reduction?
