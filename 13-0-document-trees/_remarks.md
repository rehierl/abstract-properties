- explicitly add the child order of an ordered tree to its tree order
- this will result in the true node order of an a doctree
- referred to as a (partial) extension of the doctree's tree/node order

point out the confusing situation
- by default names remain in regards to the unordered tree
- if in doubt use patterns - e.g. "a node's former subsequent sibling"

transitive closure
- a tree/graph is the cover relation of an order relation
- pointed out with the examples of orders that can be formed from a tree
- i.e. when trying to use the "parent-of" relationship to form an order

sequence of siblings
- the goal find a more generic term for a sequence
  of things that have some characteristic in common
- e.g. a sequence of peers - "peer" is less common but still already in use
