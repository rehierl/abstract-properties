ordered sequence
-> family of scopes
-> total order

family of scopes
-> path graph
-> family of scopes

remarks
- nodes/vertices within the scope of multiple properties
- properties of similar "kind"
- the relationships between the scopes of these properties
  establish a total hierarchy
- a path graph can be derived from an "ordered sequence"
- which explains why a sequence can be visualized as a path
- the sequence can be recreated the same way

extended
- intervalls require an underlying order
- introduce the intervall-based perspective
