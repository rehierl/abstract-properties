# document order / tag soup, document order

Note that the edges defined by the pre-order rule are not embedded into the
document tree. That is, according to a document tree, a first child is not
presequent to the next subsequent sibling of its parent. In other words, the
next subsequent sibling of a node is not subsequent to any descendant of that
node.
