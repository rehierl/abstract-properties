- to solidify one's perception of suborders

removal of a node
- the default operation in the context of a tree
  is the removal of an entire induced subtree
- the removal of a suffix/intervall in regards to its order
- i.e. what effects does the operation on a tree
  have on the tree's underlying partial order?

the pre-order trace of a node
- is a substring to the pre-order trace of a tree
- corresponds with the set of nodes of an induced subtree
- i.e. the pre-order trace of an induced subtree /its root
- "the scope of a node" is bound to the
  tree order of an unordered doctree
