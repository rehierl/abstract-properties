# base orders - must be substrings to DPR?

* each scope `[n,*]` over a base order must be a substring to DPR
* is "the base order must ba a substring" a consequence ?!?
* any counter example ?!?

Note that a base order is strictly speaking in principle not required to appear
as a substring to the processing order (i.e. over DPR no other node in between
its nodes).

Note that the trivial suborder DTR, the unordered doctree DTU and the ordered
doctree DTO all contain all of the nodes, each of these base orders appear as
a substring to the processing order.
