# remarks - hierarchical systems of base orders (?)

- based on "each scope must be a substring to the PO"
- relationships between the scopes of a base order
- relationships between base orders

remark

- does this allow to derive any conclusion in regards to "all exor none"?

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

Since all the scopes over all the base orders must appear as substrings to the
processing order, one might suspect that it is essential for a system of base
orders that the types of scopes over it must be hierarchical in some way.

In addition to that definitions need to allow for any node in a base order to
be used as the defining node of a scope. That is because there does not seem
to be a way to exclude certain nodes on the abstraction level of a definition.

* any node in any base order may be used as a defining node

Note that a base order itself is not required to appear as a substring to the
processing order - e.g. the node order of the unordered doctree is a "simple"
suborder, but no substring to the processing order.

- show that base orders are intermediate steps of a linear extension
- "can be" or "must be"?
