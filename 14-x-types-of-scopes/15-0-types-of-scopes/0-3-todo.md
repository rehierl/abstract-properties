Note that this notion is different to the general notion of "a scope includes
a node and all of its descendants ex-or none of these at all", which still
needs to be confirmed or dismissed.

## hierarchical base orders

Note that since scopes over a base order must be substrings to the processing
order, base orders themselves must appear as substrings to the pre-order trace.
That is because any node can potentially be used as the defining node of a
scope. Despite that, a base order is not required to be total.

* base orders must appear as substrings to the processing order

todo

* any scope must be a sbustring
* the trivial base order satisfies that requirement (1-element substrings)
