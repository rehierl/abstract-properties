# the pre-order rule
- does not correspond with a well-defined set
- i.e. there is no pre-calulated set of edges

the pre-order traversal algorithm
- is in regards to the unordered doctree
- what does the algorithm look like if it
  is in regards to the ordered doctree?

however, one can still state that
- the document order is well defined
