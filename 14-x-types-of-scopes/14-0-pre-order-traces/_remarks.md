- an extended point of view on pre-order traces

the pre-order trace of a node
- is a substring to the pre-order trace of a tree
- corresponds with the set of nodes of an induced subtree
- i.e. the pre-order trace of an induced subtree /its root
- "the scope of a node" is bound to the tree order of an unordered doctree

sequences of subsequent siblings
- in the ordered doctree
- s(n) is a suffix to s(p)
- c(n) is disjoint-to c(p)
- where (p parent-of n) is true
