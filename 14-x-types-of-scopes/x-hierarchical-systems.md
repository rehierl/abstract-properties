# remarks - hierarchical systems of base orders (?)

- does this allow to derive any conclusion in regards to "all exor none"?

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

- relationships between the scopes of a base order
- relationships between base orders

Note that, depending on a given context (i.e. a set of allowed base orders),
any node can in general be understood to be associated with several distinct
non-empty scopes.

Note that each node can be understood to be located within more than one
scope. Because of that, **hierarchies of scopes** are formed based on the
nodes the scopes have in common (e.g. subset-of, substring-of).

Since all the scopes over all the base orders must appear as substrings to the
processing order, one might suspect that it is essential for a system of base
orders that the types of scopes over it must be hierarchical in some way.

In addition to that definitions need to allow for any node in a base order to
be used as the defining node of a scope. That is because there does not seem
to be a way to exclude certain nodes on the abstraction level of a definition.

- any node in any base order may be used as a defining node

Note that a base order itself is not required to appear as a substring to the
processing order - e.g. the node order of the unordered doctree is a "simple"
suborder, but no substring to the processing order.

- show that base orders are intermediate steps of a linear extension
- "can be" or "must be"?
