general impression
- we are overly used to total orders
- we are barely aware of partial orders

rank-based sections
- use the total document order to introduce rank-based sections
- allows to explain how a node order can be broken apart

context rooted paths
- the last node of a property is subsequent to its
  defining node, because of that, the defining node
  is a node in the last node's rooted path
- a matter of consequence
