general impression
- we are overly used to total orders
- we are barely aware of partial orders

in regards to rank-based sections
- use the total document order to introduce rank-based sections
- allows to explain how a node order can be broken apart

rooted paths - context
- the last node of a property is subsequent to its defining node,
  because of that, the defining node is a node in the last node's
  rooted path - a matter of consequence

a property
- emantates from its defining nodes and is passed on
- to all those nodes that are subsequent to it
