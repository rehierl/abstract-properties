- the issue - shared properties

immediate todos
- point out that the above-of order is the pre-order

then use further hierarchies to
- introduce rank values - as node levels

# this is to introduce types of scopes

- the document order is the doctree's pre-order trace
- derived from that - types of properties/scopes

the some-but-not-all quantifier
- an end-tag separates a node's type-1 (t1)
  descendants from its remaining t2 descendants
- i.e. from the subsequent siblings and their t1 descendants
- or - from the next subsequent sibling and its t2 descendants
- as such, an end-tag provides a clear definition
  for the some-but-not-all case/qualifier
- a partition of its type-2 descendants

with that in mind, ..
- by default, a property applies to all the nodes
  that are subsequent to a defining node
- now the question is .. subsequent
  according to which node order ?!?
- rooted paths - which node order ?!?

# the transition

at first
- the focus was on flat documents - total orders
- into which we did embed a hierarchy of sections
- why did/does that seem to work seemlessly ?!?

then we moved on to hierarchies
- the focus is now on partial suborders
- all properties seem to be restricted to induced subtrees
- as if we did forget about the unrestricted case
- almost - see headings

# meta - other - later

overall
- the concept of abstract properties is an application of order theory
- a hierarchy of scopes is an application of abstract properties
- a tag soup defines a hierarchy of scopes, the partial containment order

continuous discussions
- may in general have the effect of maintaining/enforcing confusion
- since we willingly or unwillingly tend to listen
- sometimes silence and determination are the better choice
