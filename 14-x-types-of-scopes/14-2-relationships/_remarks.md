# a node and its descendants
- exor none at all ?!?

all exor none
- can a suborder end with a parent, but exclude its child nodes?
- either includes a node and all of its descendants, exor none at all
- needs substring-based considerations

possibly slightly different to ..
- a scope includes a node and all of its descendants ex-or none at all
- which still needs to be confirmed or dismissed.

point out that there are no overlapping scopes
- guaranteed by construction - related in a path graph
- disjoint exor related in a tree
