a hierarchy of edges
- related <-> a path can be formed such that
  it begins in one edge and ends in the other
- an edge-case of overlapping strings
- note - unlike ordinary hierarchies since
  the edges are not embedded into one another
- note - a graph-based point of view

two edges ex and ey are related with each other,
if a path over E can be formed such that the path
begins in the source node of one edge and ends in
the sink node of the other.

note - related edges may overlap each other.
e.g. (1,2) and (2,3)

note - overlapping edges may not be related
e.g. (1,2) and (1,3)
