- impelementation-specific aspects

proof-of-concept (poc) implementations
- this is about the concept of generic properties
  and as such a purely theoretical discussion

a length-based encoding/decoding
- based on the fact that there are multiple ways to
  derive a partial order from a node tree - each of
  which corresponds with with the source node tree
- based on the structure of a doctree's pre-order trace

it aint no (fucking) nod tree
- used to point out the implicit theoretical steps

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## node levels as rank values

level/depth vs. rank
* level/depth values are instructions to end/close nodes
* level/depth values are absolute
* users can't set them explicitly
* they can be relied upon

common aspect
* forming groups of elements
* common to the topic of sections
