a hierarchy of traces
- no trace of a node is a suborder to
  the unordered/ordered document tree
- these are still suborders to the
  doctree's pre-order trace of nodes
- in essence a hierarchy of scopes
  that consists of serialized scopes

pairs of tags - DTU, DTO
- a pair of tags encloses a node
  and its descendants in DTU
- any node in DTO has two child nodes
- the end-tag of a node separates its
  descendants in DTU from its subsequent
  siblings and their descendants
- the end-tag of a node separates
  the child nodes of a node in DTO
- the pair of tags that consists of the
  start-tag of a node and the end-tag of
  its parent encloses the descendants of
  a node in DTO
