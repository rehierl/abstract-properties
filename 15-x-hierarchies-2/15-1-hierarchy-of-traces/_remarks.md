- a tag soup does not define a tree
- instead, a tag soup defines a containment order

a hierarchy of traces
- no trace of a node is a suborder to
  the unordered/ordered document tree
- these are still suborders to the
  doctree's pre-order trace of nodes
- in essence a hierarchy of scopes
  that consists of serialized scopes

consistency of scopes
- in regards to underlining/boxing nodes
- there are no overlapping traces/sequences
- none of the borders of any two scopes cross each other
