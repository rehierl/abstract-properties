hierarchy of traces
- the child order is embedded into the pre-order traces
- but not into the scopes, so no Hs-Hpre isomorphism
- an ordered sequence of scopes is isomorphic

Note that one would have to form an ordered sequence of scopes in pre-order
from Hpre, in order to be able to recreate Hpre from it. That is because the
index-order over the scopes would then correspond with the index-order over
the nodes in the doctree's pre-order trace, which would then allow to form
the trace of each node.
