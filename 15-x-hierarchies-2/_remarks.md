a setup of sets
- as an ordered sequence of sets
- the index order provides node identifiers
- can also be understood to embed a child order

implementations
- a stack of stacks of open scopes
- relevant with hierarchies of sections/scopes
- a stack-of-stacks is consistent with the scope closing order
- if exit-events of multiple scopes match the same end-tag?
- hint - last opened, first closed - a consequence of DI-RE
