## setups of sets

```
( n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6, n7, n8, n9, n10 ) | - trace
{    ========        ================       | - s, u
         ====            =========        } | - t, v
```

Since a line can be understood to define an ordered sequence of nodes, all
lines combined can be said to define **a set of sets (of elements)**. To be
more accurate, a set of ordered sets.

If such an overall set (here, a set of scopes) does not contain even one
pair of overlapping sets, then that overall set will be referred to as
**a (proper) setup (of sets)**.

* A setup has no pair of overlapping sets.
* The sets in a setup are pairwise **disjoint ex-or related**.

As such, a setup represents in general a forest of hierarchies. However, if
a setup has **one root set only**, then the setup defines a single hierarchy.
That is, the above line-based visualizations can be used to visualize forests
and hierarchies which are as sub-orders embedded into the pre-order trace of
a tree.

Note that a root set can be understood as a set that has no superset within
the setup. Put differently, a root set is itself no subset to another set.

Note that a setup, as a set of sets which satisfies the above requirements,
corresponds with a hierarchy of sets (i.e. a partially ordered set of sets).
That is, a setup of sets can be understood to define an ordered set of sets.
