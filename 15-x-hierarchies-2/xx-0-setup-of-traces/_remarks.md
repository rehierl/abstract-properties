- in regards to families of scopes
- in the context of substrings/subsequences
- in the context of ordered sequences,
  not much of a difference to sets
- substrings <-> intervals <-> sets

a hierarchy of traces
- no trace of a node is a suborder to the
  node order of an unordered/ordered doctree
- these are however suborders to the doctree's
  pre-order trace of nodes

about
- a generalization of hierarcies of scopes
- a hierarchy of horizontal sequences
- a hierarchy of pre-order traces
- in essence a true hierarchy of scopes
  which consists of serialized scopes
- could be used to proof that a sequence
  of length values is isomorphic
- could then be used to proof that a
  sequence of level values is isomorphic

finalize with "a family of strings" ?
- just to proof that it does add up
- efficiency the ce() as the first item
- the tag soup is still an order, not a tree

scope consistency
- in regards to underlining/boxing nodes
- none of the borders of any two scopes cross each other
- there are no overlapping sequences

given a set of elements U
- a purely theoretical consideration
- what is the max number of possible hierarchies
- recall - the css of a leaf reduces U by #css,
  and thus the number of possible parent sets
- does this allow a recursive calculation?
- in regards to - resource/memory management
- most likely too large to be relevant
