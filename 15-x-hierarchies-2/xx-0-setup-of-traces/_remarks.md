- in regards to families of scopes
- in the context of substrings/subsequences
- in the context of ordered sequences,
  not much of a difference to sets
- substrings <-> intervals <-> sets

about
- a generalization of hierarcies of scopes
- a hierarchy of horizontal sequences
- a hierarchy of pre-order traces
- in essence a true hierarchy of scopes
  which consists of serialized scopes
- could be used to proof that a sequence
  of length values is isomorphic
- could then be used to proof that a
  sequence of level values is isomorphic

finalize with "a family of strings" ?
- just to proof that it does add up
- efficiency the ce() as the first item
- the tag soup is still an order, not a tree

scope consistency
- in regards to underlining/boxing nodes
- none of the borders of any two scopes cross each other
- there are no overlapping sequences

old naming convention
- consistent setup - no overlaps, no repetitions
- root sequence - no subsequence to another
- hierarchy - one root sequence only,
  contains every other subsequence
- strict/proper hierarchy - based on strict-subsequence-of
- distinct setup - each sequence is an ordered sequence
- each sequence must be a substring

here also
- sequence-based definitions for tree-based terms
- root sequence, parent sequence, ...
- what is a parent sequence in order-based terms?

content injection
- needs clear definitions in regards to
- a node contains another node
- a node is embedded as a descendant
- a set contains another set - as a subset
- a set contains another set - as an element
- suggestion - resolved/merged into
- suggestion - has a border / has no border
- meh on the - "strictly vs. loosely" aspect

given a set of elements U
- a purely theoretical consideration
- what is the max num of possible hierarchies
- recall - the css of a leaf reduces U by #css,
  and thus the number of possible parent sets
- does this allow a recursive calculation?
- in regards to - resource/memory management
- most likely too large to be relevant
