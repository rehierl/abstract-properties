# hierarchies / inner/outer sets of nodes

This chapter was taken from the old "node-tree-outliner" repository and is
being kept for "historic" reasons since it does represent the former top-down
based apporach.

Even though the contents can be considered to be no longer relevant to this
repository, one might still want to take a peek for its more "visual" and
thus more "hands-on" explanations. However, due to its less abstract nature,
this content might turn out to be more confusing than helpful.

Note that this chapter is considered outdated since it focuses on graph-based
explanations. Because of that, this chapter might be removed entirely at some
future point in time.
