# hierarchies / variations of setups

This chapter explores the **variations** that are possible when defining setups.

Note that such a variation may be to define the related-to operator using the
**subset-of** operator, rather than the superset-of operator. Likewise, the
types of relationships allowed may be restricted to the **RE-OV**. That is,
sets may be allowed to overlap each other instead of having to be disjoint if
two sets are not considered to be related with each other.

Note that **the unrelated case** (i.e. no edge between two sets) does not have
to mean that two sets can then not be automatically concluded to be disjoint.
That is, two unrelated sets may instead be required to overlap each other.

Note that this chapter is **a chapter of bullet points**. That is, this content
does not contain fleshed out sentences. Instead, it focusses on lists of bullet
points intended to highlight the aspects that are essential to the corresponding
variation.

The most notable observations are as follows ..

* No set can have disjoint supersets.
* A set may still have overlapping subsets.
* Overlapping supersets allow parallel subcomponents.

Note that parallel subcomponents in general result in nodes having more than
one rooted path (i.e. no downward-total node orders).
