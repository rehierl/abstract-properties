the value-based point of view
- the core issue is with infinitely many numbers
- hence the downward-oriented point of view
- since the set of natural numbers begins with 0/1
- there always is a finite amount of "presequent" numbers

the process-based point of view
- properties apply to "subsequent" events only
- hence the concept of scopes
- hence the upward-oriented point of view
- in the current discussion the more "natural" point of view
- however, "context" is dual to "scope"

## variations

related ex-or idc (= "i don't care")
- introduce an idc case?
- till now the focus is on di-re xor re-ov
- i.e. the unrelated case is fixed to one case only!
- i.e. the unrelated case must be one or the other
- what if you just don't care about the alternate case?
- i.e. if (di) ex-or (ov) ?

variations of partial orders (posets)
- posets allow more than containment orders can support
- with superset-of/subset-of, with (di and/or ov),
  with/against the orientation of the edges
- what are the general characteristics of each combo?
- what do containment orders support?

see partial orders in order theory
- not required to have even one edge/path
- may have any number of disconnected components
- each vertex may have any number of incoming/outgoing edges
- each component must have a root and a leaf - no cycles
- each component may have any number of source/sink vertices
- a component may have parallel sub-components

containment orders
- a subset can not have disjoint supersets
- a subset can have overlapping supersets
- i.e. can support parallel subcomponents

## hierarchy of edges

which endpoint acts as the CE of an edge?
- its source node? - similar to induced subtrees
- its sink node? - similar to rooted paths
- could depend on the orientation of a path/edge
- a scope contains nodes of its descendants
- an rscope contains nodes of its ancestors
- none of those contain nodes in the other direction
- i.e. they are uni-directional in that regards
- an edge is different in that regards since it
  provides a connection in both directions
- core issue is - edges are not embedded into one another
- might depend on one's point of view
