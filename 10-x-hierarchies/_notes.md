needs an overview
- summarize the isomorphisms
- point out which are most important

the value-based point of view
- the core issue is with infinitely many numbers
- hence the downward-oriented point of view
- since the set of natural numbers begins with 0/1
- there always is a finite amount of "presequent" numbers

the process-based point of view
- properties apply to "subsequent" events only
- hence the concept of scopes
- hence the upward-oriented point of view
- in the current discussion the more "natural" point of view
- however, "context" is dual to "scope"
