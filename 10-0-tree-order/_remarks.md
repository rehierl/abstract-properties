- what exactly is the ominous "tree order"
- also the "node order" of a tree

node tree
-> parent-of
-> ancestor-of
-> node order

remarks
- intended to formalize the notion of "node order" and "tree order"
- recall that a path graph satisfies the requirements of a node tree

remarks
- not clear if it can be merged into partial-orders
