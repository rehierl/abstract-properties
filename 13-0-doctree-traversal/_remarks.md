# document trees
- reiterate the issue with "child order"
- thus far not embedded into any tree
- explicitly add the child order of an ordered tree to its tree order
- this will result in the true node order of an a doctree
- referred to as a (partial) extension of the doctree's tree/node order

point out the confusing situation
- by default names remain in regards to the unordered tree
- if in doubt use patterns - e.g. "a node's former subsequent sibling"
