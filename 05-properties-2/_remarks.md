remarks
- build upon the introduction of generic properties
  in the context of ordered sequences (total orders)
- point out the concept of generic properties
  in the context of node trees (partial orders)

extended
- intervalls require an underlying order
- induced subtrees can be described as intervalls
- i.e. intervalls over partial orders
- the scope of a property can still be described
  as an interval over the underlying node order
