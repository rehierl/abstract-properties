note to self
- be clear
- stay on topic
- keep it slim

intermediate result
- as an intermediate goal - only flesh it out up until
  types of properties have been defined

# remarks

- document order - the pre-order trace
- tree order - the node order of a document tree

# todo

- point out the core problem with unclear instructions
  i.e. all-of or none-of vs. some-of - use venn diagrams
- introduce the generic concept of properties

introduce the term "type-x descendants"?
- instead of "the descendants in the node order of the un-ordered tree"
