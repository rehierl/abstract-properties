note to self
- be clear
- stay on topic
- keep it slim

as an intermediate goal
- flesh it out only up until types of properties are defined

# remarks

- document order - the pre-order trace
- tree order - the node order of the document tree

# todo

clear vs. unclear definitions
- point out the core issue/problem with unclear instructions
  i.e. all-of or none-of vs. some-of - use venn diagrams

generic properties
- introduce the generic concept of properties
  before moving on to graph theory

found the h1-h3-issue/fragment
- in node-tree-outliner / about

introduce the term "type-x descendants"?
- instead of "the descendants in the node order of the un-ordered tree"
