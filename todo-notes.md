note to self
- be clear
- stay on topic
- keep it slim

as an intermediate goal
- flesh it out only up until types of properties are defined

# remarks

- document order - the pre-order trace
- tree order - the node order of a document tree

# todo

- point out the core issue/problem with unclear instructions
  i.e. all-of or none-of vs. some-of - use venn diagrams
- introduce the generic concept of properties
  before moving on to graph theory

headings-2
- todo - introduce a universal section?
- allows to introduce types of sectioning nodes
- just to give a first impression

introduce the term "type-x descendants"?
- instead of "the descendants in the node order of the un-ordered tree"
