# family of paths
- obviously not any paths
- a family of rooted paths - rpaths

a chapter on families of rooted paths
- a set-/order-based point of view
- see - descriptive set theory (DST)

proof (NT <-> RP)
- alternative definitions for graph-based terms
  possible - e.g. least/greatest, ...
- flesh out some definitions

an old intuitive suspicion
- could result in a depth-based encoding
- equivalent to family of scopes?
- a prefix order ?

wikipedia: tree in dst <-> tree in order-theory
- every dst-tree is also an ot-tree
- has one minimal element
- each element has a well-ordered set of predecessors
- (a < b) := (a proper-prefix-of b)
- the empty sequence is the unique minimal element
- an ot-tree may be represented by an isomorphic tree of sequences

overlaps eq. incomparable
- set/family of rooted paths
- is "related (prefix) exor overlaps"
- a similarity to "related exor disjoint"
- note - overlaps has no orientation
- siblings are disjoint and thus incomparable
