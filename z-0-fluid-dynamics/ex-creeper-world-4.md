note the game didn't invent ..
- fluid dynamics, geographical maps, logical layering

creeper world, a video game
- sarch https://youtu.be for "creeper world 4"
- ignore the gameplay mechanics
- in regards to the context of this discuission,
  these mechanics are visual clutter
- focus on the layering of the landscape
- focus on the fluid dynamics instead

fluid dynamics
- "flat/layered" 3d maps with creeper spawners
- spawners act as sources/roots for the creeper "fluid" (i.e. the enemy)
- the creeper flows along the height differentials of the map
- if the creeper covers the entire map, you loose the game/round

map layering
- the map is layered with layers of equal height
- the height of the map increases/decreases one height-diff at a time

logical layering
- crimson creeper
- adds additional features to the current/normal creeper
- armor/invulnerable against kinetic attacks
