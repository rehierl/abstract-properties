# shared (abstract) properties

As was introduced with abstract properties, **each line** drawn above/below an
ordered sequence can be understood to define a subset over an ordered sequence.
And since any ordered sequence can be understood to correspond with a total
order, each line can be said to define **an interval**. Based on that, each
layer in the side scroller can be said to visualize an interval.

```
(height)
l3 |           =====|
l2 | Â¤    ==========|
l1 |================| (width)
   | c1 - c2 - c3 ->|
```

Furthermore, each first element in an interval can be seen as the defining
node/element of an abstract property. That is, `ci` is the defining node of
`pi`, and layer/line `li` the visualization of its scope `s(ci)`.

* `s(p1) = {c1, c2, c3}`, `s(p2) = {c2, c3}` and `s(p3) = {c3}`

Since each next cell `cj` is, at this point, understood to define a new
property `pj`, each next cell can be said to be within the scope of all
of those properties that were declared by all the `ci` that are presequent
to `cj`.

Since each property `pi` has a scope `s(pi)` that may extend over any number
of cells, one can state that **properties are shared across each scope**.

* cells within the scope of a property
* properties are shared across cells

Since any cell may be an element in any number of scopes, any cell an be said
to be associated with each such roperty. That is, one can assume that each
cell is associated with a set of properties `p(c)` that contains all of those
properties to which the cell belongs.

* `p(ci) := { pj | (ci in s(pj)) }`
* `p(c1) = {p1}`, `p(c2) = {p1, p2}` and `p(c3) = {p1, p2, p3}`

Since each cell `ci` has a set of properties `p(ci)` that may extend over any
number of properties, one can state that **cells are shared across properties**.

* properties may apply to multiple cells
* cells are shared across properties
