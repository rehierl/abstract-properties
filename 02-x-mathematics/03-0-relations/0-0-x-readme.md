# relations (REL)
- an overview of mathematical relations

The focus of this chapter is on endo-relations `R := (A,A,G) := (A,G)` (i.e.
binary relations formed from a simple set of elements/vertices (A) and the
connections (G) between them. In general, the focus of "relations" is on the
characteristics (e.g. symmetric, transitive, etc) of the set of connections (G).
