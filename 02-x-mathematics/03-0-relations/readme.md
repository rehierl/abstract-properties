# mathematics / relations (REL)

The focus of this repository is on **endo-relations** `R := (A,G)` -
i.e. binary relations formed from a simple set of elements/vertices (A)
and the connections (G) between these elements.

Note that the focus of such relations is in general on the properties of the
set connections (G). In the context of this repository, the most relevant
definitions are the following:

* transitive, a-symmetric, trichotomous
* left/right-unique/total, injective, surjective, bijective
* transitive closure/reduction

Note also the introduction to **graph-based visualizations**.
