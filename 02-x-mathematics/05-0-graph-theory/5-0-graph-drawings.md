# graph drawings

The description "Graph drawing" refers to the visual representation of a graph.
That is, the methods that are being used to draw a graph onto a two-dimensional
plane.

Most frequently, a graph is drawn as a node-link diagram that depicts vertices
as disks or boxes, and the edges as arrows or lines between the vertices.
Examples of such drawings are flowcharts (the vertices represent processing
steps and the edges control flow) and hasse diagrams (drawings of posets).

Despite its visual representation, one must always keep in mind that the visual
representation of a graph is the specific layout of the graph's endo-relation.
That is, a graph can in general be layed out using various different methods.
A particular graph drawing must therefore not be confused with the graph's
underlying endo-relation.

Note that the focus of this discussion is on the endo-relation of a graph, not
on any specific visual representation.
