# the things we know

- the words we use are in regards to the "things" we know
- but how does one describe what one does not know?
- how does one describe what is "new"?
- with words that are defined for things we know?
- with words that already have meaning
- confusion can not be avoided ...

the tricky bit

- one can in general not define new words and descriptions
- and then stick with them until the end of times
- we are humans, we make errors, we need to correct our selves
- that adds to the confusion

overall

- this isn't about "reading between the lines"
- this is about learning how to see structure amongst noise
