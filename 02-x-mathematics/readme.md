This meta chapter is a summary of basic mathematical concepts. Since it does
not redefine mathematics as a whole, it must be understood to reflect my point
of view on basic definitions, and to establish a certain style of notation.

Note that there are certain **non-standard definitions**, which will be used
throughout this repository.
