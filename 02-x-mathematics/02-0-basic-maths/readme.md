# mathematics / basic concepts

Recall that container types in mathematics are based on **components**,
which can be described as slots, each of which can hold one element only.

Note that there are certain **non-standard** definitions such as **E()**,
**ordered sequences**, **presequent** and **characteristic subset css()**,
which will be used throughout this entire repository.

Note the **all-of**, **none-of** and **some-of** quantifiers, which have
their footing in the relationships between sets of elements. These have
subtle, but fundamental impact on definitions throughout this repository.
After all, the some-of quantifier is inherently difficult to clarify.

Note that **intervals** do not have to be number-based intervals. It depens
on a given context, which type of elements can be used to specify an interval.
Also, an interval is in principle a short-hand definition of a simple set of
elements, those that satisfy the condition. However, depending of a given
context, an interval can implicitly be understood as the short-hand definition
of a complex construct (e.g. a substring), which must be induced from a more
complex construct based on a fixed known rule.

Note that an interval-based perspective allows for a more abstract point of
view on the definitions of **prefix**, **infix** and **suffix**. This abstract
point of view allows to use these terms with non-linear orders.
