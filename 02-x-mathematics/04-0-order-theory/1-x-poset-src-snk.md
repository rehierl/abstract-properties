# partial order (poset)

* a preorder - (reflexive +) transitive
* a poset - a anti-/a-symmetric preorder

that is ..

* no cycles allowed
* no other restriction

## the transitive reduction of a poset

```
v1 -> v2
v3
```

* may have disconnected vertices

```
     |-> v2 ->|
v1 ->|        |-> v4
     |-> v3 ->|
```

* may have incomparable vertices
* any vertex may have any number of incoming edges
* any vertex may have any number of outgoing edges

```
v1 ->|-> v3
v2 ->|
```

* may have any number of source vertices

```
v1 ->|-> v3
     |-> v4
```

* may have any number of leaf vertices
