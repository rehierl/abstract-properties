## interval order

An interval order `P := (I,<)` consists of a set of intervals `I` on real
numbers and an order over these intervals that is defined as follows:

* `i := [iLe,iRi]` for `(i in I)`
* `(i < j) := (iRi < jLe)` for `(i,j in I)`
* note - `i` is completely left of `j`

An order may be described as an interval order, if it is order-isomorphic
to such an interval order.
