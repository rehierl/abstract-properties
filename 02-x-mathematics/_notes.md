# fundamental concepts

container types are based upon components
- interconnected components
- an order over the components of a container
- the order of a simple set is ... total!

point out the similarties between the operators
- defined for sets and sequences
- i.e. subset-of, substring-of
- lost thought - the quantififers ?!?

# graph theory (GT)

semantics of an edge
- if an edge has semantics, then these semantics
  usually also apply to any pair of matching edges
- that is, if semantics are transitive, then the
  resulting graph is itself transitive
- e.g. parent-of vs. ancestor-of

graph property
- should probably have an explanation
- describes the general characteristic of a graph
- e.g. each node has a unique rooted path

hereditary (graph) properties
- applies to any subgraph

bipartite graph
- V is a union of two disjoint subsets
- bends the definition of an endo-relation
- i.e. more of a binary relation

graph theory seems to focus on edges
- disconnected vertices (seem) to get (mostly) ignored
- e.g. the (standard) definition of a complement graph

# document trees

- flesh out "the things we know"
- fits as "meta" into the overall context
