# why keep this chapter?

Since this chapter is more or less only used to introduce labeled graph-based
visualizations, the question arises as to why one would then even want keep it?
After all, the visualizations could be introduced at a different place just as
easily.

The decision to hold on to it has a lot to do with the "gut feeling" I have
in regards to CT. Despite the fact that most such impressions turn out to be
nothing more than mere bathtub thoughts, which can be dismissed sooner or
later, others turn out to be more than that - especially if they just won't
go away on their own.

There are several ways in dealing with such impressions. One of which is to
just scrap them either completely (aka. choose to forget about them), or to
write them down as a private, non-public note. The impression I have from CT
does however not justify such a step. That is because CT itself, seems too
useful to the overall discussion as a high-level layer of abstraction. Because
of that, and even though CT is largely "unknown" to me, I choose to hold on
to it .. in public.

That is because making this impression public has an aspect to it I can not
ignore: Even if it might still turn out to be "nothing", it does take time to
develop such an impression. Because of that, holding on to it means to let
others know that there could be something to it. This in turn allows others
to save time in not having to develop that impression themselves. They can
then choose to pick up that thought, or to simply skip it.

The key here is that one shouldn't simply scarp a "thing" if it could still
turn out to be relevant. Be it to confirm what is being discussed, or to even
prove it wrong. If one such result comes from keeping it, then holding on to
it was worth it either way.

That being said, you don't choose to not point something out just because you
don't fully understand it, since that would be like acting as if the "lack of
knowledge" didn't exist.
