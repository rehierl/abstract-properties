# category theory (CT)
- an introduction to category theory

Note that the content in this chapter reflects my level of understanding of
Category Theory (CT). At this point, that understanding can unfortunately only
be summarized as some general first impression. The following content will thus
barely scratch the surface of CT. Because of that, the following must be taken
with a grain of salt .. a lot of salt.

Note that, despite my lack of understanding, the visualizations used in CT
allow to provide visual summaries of transformation processes (as introduced
below) from one class of objects to another class of objects. The focus of
this chapter is therefore to introduce such visualizations.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

In essence, a (level-1) category is a directed graph such that its vertices
represent specific objects of some kind and the edges transformations (aka.
morphisms from one object to another. Such categories can therefore be
understood to represent groups of concrete objects.

* e.g. a set of trees and the operations between them

On the next higher level of abstraction, a (level-2) category can be understood
to have (level-1) categories as its objects, and morphisms (aka. functors) from
one such category to another. Such categories can therefore be understood to
describe how groups of objects can be transformed into one another.

* e.g. isomorphisms between node trees and order relations

Beyond that, a (level-3) category may be understood to generalize the concept
of transformations between categories. As such, the focus here is to describe
the characteristics of transformations.

Note that the focus on CT in the context of this discussion is on **level-2**
categories which contain isomorphisms between its (inner) categories.
